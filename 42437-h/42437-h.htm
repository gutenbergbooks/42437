<p class="title2">Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s Will</p>


<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a><br />

RED PINEYS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bird O&rsquo;More</span> crouched in a little black heap in
the corner of the sofa that stood between the closed
windows in the farmhouse sitting room. Her eyes,
that looked straight before her, yet without seeing
anything, were quite dry; but her feverish cheeks,
that she pressed against the cool haircloth, and the
twisting of her fingers in the folds of her gown, told of
grief, as well as her black frock and the closed blinds.</p>

<p>Outside the house, in the road, half a dozen country
teams were hitched to the rickety fence, while their
owners roamed about the yard, talking in low voices,
and occasionally wondering aloud &ldquo;when the women
folks would be ready to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the women folks had no idea of going yet, and
small wonder, for they had come from a funeral that
had made poor Bird an orphan; they had much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
discuss, and without them, also, she would be all
alone at the farm that lay on a straggling cross-road
a mile from neighbours, as if it, like its recent owners,
had tried to hide from those who had known it in
better days.</p>

<p>The little girl had been christened Bertha, after
her grandmother, but as, from the time she could
speak a word, she was always singing, her father had
called her &ldquo;Bird.&rdquo; Yet this day the little bird in her
throat was mute and only made a strange fluttering;
so that the neighbours, talking in whispers as they
drank the tea that a stout, rosy woman, who seemed
to be in charge, was serving in the kitchen, said,
&ldquo;Poor child, if she&rsquo;d only let go and cry it out natural,
it would do her good; but that dry sobbing is
enough to break a body&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as she gradually grew quiet, dulled by fatigue
and the heat of the room, her head sliding down on
her arm in heavy sleep, they drew sighs of relief and
their voices arose in chat about the happenings of the
last few days and the natural question as to what was
to become of Bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she got any folks either side?&rdquo; asked a
young woman who had but recently moved into
Laurelville, and did not yet know the comings and
goings and kith and kin of her neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Only her father&rsquo;s half-brother,&rdquo; spoke up the
rosy woman, Mrs. Lane by name, &ldquo;and he lives way
down in New York City. Joshua wrote him ten
days back when Mr. More took sick; but he never
answered, so two days ago he wrote again. Joshua
says he guesses maybe they&rsquo;ve moved, for folks are
awful restless down in York, and shift around as
often as every few years&mdash;says he reckons you
have to if you&rsquo;re anybody, cause there&rsquo;s sudden fashions
in buildings down there as well as in clothes,
and they get made over frequent to keep in style,
likewise the streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t even have known his name if
Mis&rsquo; More hadn&rsquo;t told me about him before she died,
two years back. You see,&rdquo; turning to Mrs. Tilby,
the newcomer, &ldquo;she was Sarah Turner, born and
raised over at the Milltown, and, being an only
child, was give her own head a good deal. I must
allow she was pretty, and had those big black eyes
that you can&rsquo;t guess what they&rsquo;re seeing, same as
Bird&rsquo;s got. Her folks felt dreadful bad when she
wouldn&rsquo;t take up with any of the solid fellers who
would have taken pride in the farm and mill business,
but married young O&rsquo;More that nobody knew
a speck about, except that he claimed to be an artist,
but folks didn&rsquo;t buy his pictures, and I don&rsquo;t wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for there&rsquo;s some up attic now, and you have to stand
way back to even see a shape to &rsquo;em, being not near
as clear as those that come extry with the Sunday
papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mis&rsquo; Slocum, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> take Sunday papers, on
&rsquo;count of Joshua&rsquo;s aunt&rsquo;s husband being deacon, and
not desirin&rsquo; to call trouble on the family; but if he
wasn&rsquo;t I would, for besides them pictures an&rsquo; readin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; advertisements, that wonderful they&rsquo;d raise curiosity
in froze dough, there&rsquo;s your money&rsquo;s worth o&rsquo;
paper for carpet linin&rsquo; or kindlin&rsquo; over and above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was I? Mis&rsquo; Slocum, you shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo;
set me off the track, so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not giving Mis&rsquo; Tilby a
clear idee of how it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I remember,&mdash;his wall pictures not sellin&rsquo;,
he got a job to paint posies and neat little views
the size of your hand on the inside covers of sewin&rsquo;-machine
boxes and trays and work-tables over in
Northboro. It paid first-rate, I guess, for a spell,
so after the old folks died, they sold out the farm
and mill and moved into town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Bird here was five years old or so, O&rsquo;More
had a knock-down, for they got some kind of a machine
in the factory that could do pictures quicker
than he, and at the same time the folks that had
bought the place on a mortgage caved in, and, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
havin&rsquo; no sense themselves and lawyers, most
everything was ate up and mixed so&rsquo;s Mis&rsquo; O&rsquo;More
lost the mill and all, and they moved out here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; More&mdash;folks round here never could swaller
the O&rsquo;, it being the sign, as it were, of a furrin
race and religion&mdash;just drew in like a turtle in a
shell, losin&rsquo; hope altogether, and never went any
place. And as for Terence,&mdash;that was him, Bird
always callin&rsquo; him &lsquo;Terry&rsquo; like he was her brother,&mdash;I
suppose he was always what bustlin&rsquo; folks like us
would call slack; but after he came here, he seemed
to grow happy in spite of the fact that only one shop,
the work-box and the picture-frame one, gave him
jobs. He painted out his flowers as careful, no two
pictures alike, and when I said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do
one and copy it&mdash;it would be less trouble,&rsquo; he looked
up sort of reproachful and said, &lsquo;It makes me happy
to do good work, Mrs. Lane; a machine can do the
other kind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; More fretted herself to death, dumblike,
same as snow disappears, and it&rsquo;s two years now that
Bird and her father have made out to get along
alone. Once in a time old Dinah Lucky would
come up and wash or scrub a day, and he and Bird
always was together, and he learned her to be what
I call a real lady, and never hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to say poetry and write a fine hand, and draw out
flowers so you&rsquo;d know &rsquo;em right off. The s&rsquo;lectmen
went after him onct &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;d never sent the girl to
school, but when they found she knew more&rsquo;n the
grammar grade, they kept their hands off from her;
and as for speakin&rsquo;,&mdash;since she talked plain, she&rsquo;s
spoke nicer, and chose her words better&rsquo;n anybody
but story-books and the parson, which come natural,
her mother bein&rsquo; well learned and her father havin&rsquo;
a tone of voice not belonging in these parts. Never
a cross word did he speak or a complaint, so I guess
it was true he was born a gentleman on one side, as
poor Sarah always claimed, and it stuck to him all
through, too, for the day he died he worried for
troublin&rsquo; me to draw him a cool drink, saying, &lsquo;The
well-sweep was out of repair,&rsquo; which it was, Mis&rsquo;
Slocum, <em>awful</em>, &lsquo;and too heavy for a woman to
handle,&rsquo; as if I wasn&rsquo;t always stronger than two
of him. But then I never was, and never will be,
his kind of a lady, for there&rsquo;s folks whose feelin&rsquo;s
I&rsquo;m just achin&rsquo; to hurt if I knew a sure way. And
now to think of it, Bird left at only thirteen with no
own folks and little better&rsquo;n nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Less than nothin&rsquo;, <em>I</em> should say,&rdquo; put in Mrs.
Slocum, setting her cup in its saucer with an unnecessary
clash, &ldquo;for what&rsquo;s here won&rsquo;t pay Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Slocum his back rent on the place and the fence
rails of the south lot that they&rsquo;ve seemingly used
for firin&rsquo;. <em>I</em> should say that the clothes on the girl&rsquo;s
back didn&rsquo;t fairly belong to her, mournin&rsquo; and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is only a little turned thirteen from what
you say she has schoolin&rsquo; enough to pass for fourteen
and get work in the factory. I&rsquo;ll keep her if she&rsquo;ll
help me evenings and she gets enough to pay full
board,&mdash;growin&rsquo; girls eats hearty,&rdquo; and Mrs. Slocum
settled back in her chair, folding her arms as if
she expected Mrs. Lane to be speechless at her
generosity.</p>

<p>Speechless she was for a few moments, but for a
different cause&mdash;a struggle between prudence and
a quick but just temper&mdash;then she said very slowly
and distinctly: &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Slocum, the back rent is not for
me to deny you, but the fence rails is and the few
clothes the poor lamb&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo; also. There hasn&rsquo;t
been any fence to that south lot since the summer
before my Sammy was born and I was there berryin&rsquo;
and noticed the rails was rotted and fell, and that&rsquo;s
fifteen years! As to clothes, they was give her outside
of the family, which was me, ma&rsquo;am, made out of
those that belonged to my Janey and for her sake, and
besides which a minor child isn&rsquo;t liable for her father&rsquo;s
debts, &lsquo;it bein&rsquo; the law,&rsquo; as Joshua says, and he knows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned this in public, except
some folks needs to have witnesses around before
they can take in things, Mis&rsquo; Jedge o&rsquo; Probate Ricker
bein&rsquo; here makin&rsquo; it quite suitable for me to testify.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for who&rsquo;ll take her, there&rsquo;s those that&rsquo;ll ask no
board, but Joshua says &lsquo;no one&rsquo;s got a right until the
uncle either turns up or else doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; which I&rsquo;d much
prefer. And there&rsquo;ll be no talk of factory and passin&rsquo;
her for above her age, Mis&rsquo; Slocum, I bein&rsquo; the niece-in-law
to a deacon, as I&rsquo;ve said before, should feel
called upon to testify and give the truth a full airing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever action Mrs. Slocum would have taken, it
was sidetracked by the minister&rsquo;s wife, who, with a
sharp warning cough and a hurried &ldquo;s&rsquo;h&rsquo;ush, she&rsquo;s
awake,&rdquo; turned the attention toward the darkened
room again.</p>

<p>Bird rubbed her eyes drowsily, then started up
murmuring, &ldquo;Yes, Terry, I&rsquo;m coming, I didn&rsquo;t mean
to fall asleep,&rdquo; as if she fancied herself called, stumbled
toward the door, saw the kitchen full of people,
while the bright light and lilac perfume of the May
afternoon came through the open door. Then she
remembered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, let me wash your face and freshen you up
a bit,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane, whisking out a clean handkerchief
and dipping it in the water bucket, while at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>same time she put her arm around Bird to cut off her
retreat. &ldquo;Now, that is better. Just a sip of tea,
dearie, and a bite, and then go out and get a mouthful
of air, while I open up the windows, for it&rsquo;s sizzling
in here if it does lack two days yet of almanac
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bird crouched in a black heap.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>The child did as she was told, gave her friend one
grateful look, and slipped out the door without speaking,
much to the relief of the others, the minister&rsquo;s
wife nodding caution to Mrs. Tilby who said: &ldquo;Sakes
alive! she scart me silly, gropin&rsquo; in that way. I do
wonder how much she heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile as Bird disappeared around the house a
tall boy, carrying a big bunch of red peonies, came
up the track in the grass that served as a path. It
was Sammy, or Lammy Lane, as he was usually
called, clad in his best clothes and red with running,
having only come to a full stop as he reached the
kitchen door, where he stood looking anxiously in,
the flowers clutched nervously in both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lammy Lane, where&rsquo;ve you bin, to go and miss
the funeral and all, when I started you out close after
breakfast?&rdquo; asked his mother, fiercely, yet with an
air of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catchin&rsquo; fish in the brook with his eyes, I reckon,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Slocum, with a glittering smile, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
very trying to Mrs. Lane, for Lammy, the youngest
of her three sons, was not esteemed over clever, in
fact a sort of village Johnny-Look-in-the-Air, always
going to do something that he never did, and lacking
in courage to boot. In fact the twisting of the name
of Sammy into Lammy was really a slur upon his
lack of sand and the fighting spirit natural to the
average boy.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that Lammy at this time was
not a beauty with his tousled reddish hair, freckles,
and lean colt&rsquo;s legs, but no one who was a judge of
faces could look in his straightforward gray eyes and
at the firm line of his chin without feeling that here
was the makings of a man, if people did not meddle
with the plan God had for his work.</p>

<p>Lammy&rsquo;s eyes roved about, and, not seeing the object
he wanted, answered his mother slowly, as if it
was hard to remember exactly where he had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been at Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s most all day until
now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;When I took the butter down
after breakfast, she wanted me to help her fix up
cause she didn&rsquo;t feel smart, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then there was the
chickens to feed, and Jake he didn&rsquo;t go yesterday to
spread the grass under the strawberries, and she said
if it rained, they&rsquo;d spoil, so I did that; &rsquo;n&rsquo; then I ate
dinner, &rsquo;n&rsquo; dressed up again and started. Then I remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I told Bird I&rsquo;d cut her some o&rsquo; Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
red pineys for her to take along up there,&rdquo; nodding
his head backward toward the hillside graveyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s awful particular about those red
pineys, and she wouldn&rsquo;t let me cut &rsquo;em. She came
out in the yard to do it herself, but it took her a long
while, and when she&rsquo;d got them tied up, she said,
&lsquo;Best go to the house now for they&rsquo;ll be back, and
tell your ma to come over to-night, for somehow I
feel all strange and worked up as if I was going to
have a spell,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m late, and where&rsquo;s
Bird?&rdquo; he ended abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lammy Lane, do you mean that aunt is threatened
with a spell, and you&rsquo;ve took all this time to tell
me?&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane, hardly believing her ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neighbours, I&rsquo;ll have to close up here, Joshua bein&rsquo;
in charge, as it were, as Mis&rsquo; Jedge o&rsquo; Probate Ricker
understands, until a &rsquo;ministrator&rsquo;s fixed on, but we
can meet to-morrow forenoon to wash up and discuss
the situation. Goodness me, I hope Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
no more&rsquo;n overtired!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be surprisin&rsquo; if you was resigned to
the worst, seein&rsquo; your expectations through being the
favourite nephew&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Mrs. Slocum, slyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expectations, fiddlesticks!&rdquo; snorted Mrs. Lane,
&ldquo;you know perfectly well, Mis&rsquo; Slocum, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Lord and I are working together as hard as we can
to give Aunt Jimmy every breath of life that&rsquo;s coming
to her, and seein&rsquo; that she enjoys it too, her
ownin&rsquo; the best southslope fruit garden between Milltown
and Northboro having nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lammy, do you go round, and I guess you&rsquo;ll find
Bird back of the shed, and you can take her a walk
to fetch the posies up yonder, and then bring her
down to our house for supper; and if I don&rsquo;t get
back first, the butt&rsquo;ry key is in the kitchen clock, and
you and pa can set out a full table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young company&rsquo;s best for the young in sorrow,&rdquo;
she added to the group as Lammy shot off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mis&rsquo; Slocum, those spoons is real silver, but
biting &rsquo;em &rsquo;ll injure them new teeth o&rsquo; yourn, and not
profit you anything, for they&rsquo;re <em>my</em> spoons I fetched
up for the funeral, minding how well the Turners
always set out things at such times in the old days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this parting shot Mrs. Lane shooed the
women out and locked the door, called Joshua from
the group of men who were examining a broken-down
grindstone for lack of better occupation,
climbed into the old buggy, and disappeared in a
cloud of dust, the others following until they scattered
at the four corners.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>As Mrs. Lane had said, Bird was behind the shed.
She was sitting on an old log, her face between her
hands, as she looked across the fresh green grass to
where the ragged spiræas and purple and white
lilacs waved against the sky. Leaning against her
knees was a queer little rough-haired, brown terrier
with unkempt, lopping ears, his keen eyes intent on
her face as if he knew that she was in trouble, and
only waited for some signal that he might understand
to go to her aid, while he vainly licked her
hands to attract her attention.</p>

<p>As Lammy came around the corner suddenly, at
first the dog gave a growl, and then bounding toward
the boy fairly leaped into his arms in joy, for
Twinkle, named for his keen twitching eyes, had
once been Lammy&rsquo;s best-beloved pup, that he had
given to Bird for a companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Twinkle, where&rsquo;ve you been these days?&rdquo;
said the boy, holding the flowers at arm&rsquo;s-length with
one hand, while he tucked the little dog between his
shoulder and neck with the other. &ldquo;Seems to me
you&rsquo;ve got pretty thin wherever you&rsquo;ve tramped to.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill013"></a>
<img src="images/ill013.jpg" width="387" height="528" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Bird, Lammy, and Twinkle.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been away,&rdquo; answered Bird, looking
up; &ldquo;he was hiding all the time in Terry&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean
father&rsquo;s room, and to-day, after they took <em>him</em> away,
he knew it wasn&rsquo;t any use waiting any longer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he came out, and Lammy, you&mdash;know&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;all&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;got&mdash;now,&rdquo;
and, burying her face in the
terrier&rsquo;s ragged coat, she broke into a perfect storm
of crying.</p>

<p>Lammy felt like crying, too, and in fact a tear
rolled so far down on his cheek that he had to struggle
hard to lick it up, for Bird was his dear friend,
the only girl in the village who had never laughed at
him or called him &ldquo;Nose-in-the-Air,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Look-up-Lammy,&rdquo;
and seemed to understand the way in which
he saw things. At first he looked around helplessly,
and then remembering that his mother had gone, and
that he must get Bird down to his home before supper-time,
he blurted out: &ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you reckon
Twinkle&rsquo;s pretty hungry by this? I guess we&rsquo;d better
get him some feed down to my house, and you
can leave these red pineys over yonder as we go
along if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lammy could not have done better, for Bird
sprang up instantly, all the pity aroused for the dog,
and, turning toward the house, said: &ldquo;How selfish of
me; we&rsquo;ll go in and get him something right away.
Do you think the people have gone yet? &lsquo;They
mean kindly,&rsquo; Terry used to say. I must never forget
that, but they talked so much I couldn&rsquo;t seem to
bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve gone; mother wouldn&rsquo;t leave them
behind &rsquo;cause of Mis&rsquo; Slocum,&rdquo; and he began to tell
her about his Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s ill turn and of his delay
in getting back with the flowers.</p>

<p>Bird listened quietly, and as they stood before the
door of the silent, empty house, a strange look
crossed the girl&rsquo;s face that frightened poor gentle
Lammy, as she gazed straight before her and said:
&ldquo;Now I know that I was not asleep this afternoon,
only dull and faint, and that what I thought was a
dream was partly true. Terry <em>did</em> owe rent to Mrs.
Slocum, and that was what he tried to tell me and
couldn&rsquo;t when he said there was only a little bit of
money in the Centre bank to pay for things, so that I
must be sure and keep his paint-box and the pictures
in the big portfolio. The Slocums might try to take
them. That&rsquo;s why your mother made the people go
and locked the door. Oh, Lammy, I haven&rsquo;t any
home or anything of my very own but Twinkle, but
I could work and learn to paint. Terry said I could
and if everything gave out, I can open the keepsake
bag. See, I&rsquo;ve got it now,&rdquo; and Bird pulled out a
small, flat, leather case, strongly sewed together, that
hung close around her neck on a thin gold chain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo; asked Lammy,
fingering it curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I think it&rsquo;s a piece of gold money; for
it&rsquo;s round, though one side is thicker than the other.
Mother wore it, and then father put it about my neck
for me to keep, and he said his mother gave it to him
when he came away from home long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Bird stood looking at the house, the afternoon
shadows began to fall and a change came over her.
That morning the thought of leaving the place
frightened her, but now the thing she most wanted
was to get away. &ldquo;Lammy,&rdquo; she cried presently,
&ldquo;we must get those pictures and the paint-box <em>now</em>;
to-morrow the people may come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mother&rsquo;s taken the key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, the cellar-door flap doesn&rsquo;t
fasten&mdash;it never has since I can remember&mdash;we
can go in that way,&rdquo; and then Lammy, quaking
mightily, though he didn&rsquo;t know why, followed Bird
into the house.</p>

<p>Love lights up many a dark, shabby room, and Bird
had never been lonely with her father for a companion,
and in spite of his own shiftlessness and poverty
he had taught her much that she never would forget;
but now love had gone, and as she crept down the
rickety stairs hugging the box, Lammy stumbling
after with the portfolio, her only desire was to go
somewhere, anywhere to get away, lingering only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
moment in the kitchen to collect some scraps of food
for the dog. When they reached the porch, they
stopped to fasten the things together with some
twine from Lammy&rsquo;s pocket. The portfolio was full
of flower pictures and some designs such as wall-papers
are made from. Bird turned them over
lovingly, explaining as she did so that a man in New
York had written to Terry that if he could do these
well, he could earn money, and that he was only waiting
for spring flowers to begin. The letter was still
in the portfolio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here is one of red peonies all
ready to put the last color in, and father was only
waiting for them to bloom, but it is too late now, so
we will take them to him,&rdquo; and she took the bouquet
from Lammy, gently kissing each of the glowing
flowers; and then they went out of the yard in
silence, Twinkle first, then Lammy with the bundle,
while Bird hesitated a moment; lifting the sagging
gate she dragged it to, fastened it to the post with
the old barrel hoop that had replaced the latch, and
with one parting look shook the tears from her long
lashes and walked straight down the road. At the
gate of the little graveyard Lammy put down the
bundle, and they went in together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ve made it look nice until dad can turf it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
over,&rdquo; said Lammy, &ldquo;and put a little Christmas tree
for a head-mark,&rdquo; and sure enough the mound that a
few hours before was a heap of rough gravel was
green with young bayberry twigs and spruce branches,
for on the upper side of the hill had once been a
great nursery of evergreens, the seed had scattered,
and the fragrant little Christmas trees had run all
down the hill and clustered in groups around the
fence posts.</p>

<p>Kneeling very carefully, Bird arranged the crimson
peonies. The country folk thought only white
flowers proper for such a place, but Bird loved colour
and Lammy&rsquo;s gift cheered her more than any words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Janey&rsquo;s close by here and grandma,&rdquo; said
Lammy, presently, &ldquo;so it won&rsquo;t be a bit lonesome
for your father, and I was hoping to-day that he&rsquo;d
remember to tell Janey that you&rsquo;re going to be my
sister now and come down and live at our house, for
she&rsquo;ll be glad that mother and I won&rsquo;t be so lonesome
as we&rsquo;ve been at our home since she went
to heaven. &rsquo;Cause you will stop with us, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he added earnestly as he saw Bird hesitate.
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s going to fix it just as soon as she gets
word from your uncle. She didn&rsquo;t want to write,
only dad said she&rsquo;d ought to because of the law or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always love you, Lammy,&rdquo; said Bird, slowly,
the tears gathering again, &ldquo;and I never can like any
place so much as this, and I&rsquo;ll never forget to-day
and the red peonies and your covering up the ugly
stones, but I&rsquo;ve got to earn my living and I can&rsquo;t
be a drag on anybody. I thought, you know, if
there was enough left to get to a city,&mdash;New York,
perhaps,&mdash;I might learn to paint quicker, and perhaps
the man that wanted Terry to make pictures
for wall-paper might tell me how,&rdquo; and then the
poor child, tired and overcome with the long strain
and the new loneliness, could keep up no longer, and,
throwing her arms about Lammy&rsquo;s neck, sobbed,
&ldquo;Oh, take me somewhere out of sight, for I feel as
if I was all falling&mdash;way down a&mdash;deep&mdash;well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor little Bird! All that she knew of the great
city was from the pictures in the papers and an
occasional magazine, and it seemed to her so big
and gay and busy that there must be some place
in it for her, and now that night was coming, the
country felt so empty and lonely to the little girl,
faint from weariness, and with the door of all the
home she had known closed upon her. For no one
but Lammy had had time to really comfort her,
and in her unhappiness God seemed to have taken
her parents away and then hidden Himself. If only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Aunt Jimmy had not had the spell just then and she
could have laid her head on Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s motherly
bosom, how different it might all have been. A
carriage passed as they turned into the highway, and
the clanking of the harness made Bird lift her head
from Lammy&rsquo;s shoulder where she had hidden it,
and looking up she met the eyes of a young girl
who was sitting alone on the back seat of the handsome
victoria. She was perhaps sixteen, or a little
over,&mdash;the braids of pale golden hair were fastened
up loosely behind,&mdash;and she was beautifully dressed;
but it was not the clothes but her sweet face and
wistful big gray eyes that made Bird look a second
time, and then the carriage had passed by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How happy she must be,&rdquo; thought Bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather walk than ride, and wear stubby shoes,
or go barefoot, if I only had a brother so that I need
not go alone,&rdquo; was what the other girl thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Marion Clarke that lives in the big
stone house on the hill before you come to Northboro,&rdquo;
quoth Lammy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one of her,
and she can have everything she wants.&rdquo; Then
he straightway forgot her. Bird did not, however,
for there was something in the gray eyes that would
not let themselves be forgotten.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the Lane farmhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Bird was quiet again, though her eyes drooped with
sleep, and Lammy was telling eagerly how next
autumn they could perhaps go over to Northboro
to school, for drawing was taught there, and, he
confided to Bird what had never before taken the
form of words, that he too longed to learn to draw,
not flowers, but machinery and engines, such as
pulled the trains over at the Centre.</p>

<p>As they came in sight of the house Lammy
noticed that there was a strange team at the gate,
a buggy from the livery-stable at the Centre, for
quiet Lammy kept his eyes open, and knew almost
every horse in the county. On the stoop a short,
thick-set man, with a fat, clean-shaven face, and clad
in smart black clothes, stood talking to Lammy&rsquo;s
father.</p>

<p>Both men glanced up the road from time to time,
and then Lammy noticed that the stranger held his
watch in his hand, and he kept fidgeting and looking
at it as if in a great hurry.</p>

<p>As the children entered the gate they heard Mr.
Lane say, &ldquo;Here she is now, but you can&rsquo;t catch
that evenin&rsquo; train from the Centre; you&rsquo;ll have to
put over here until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird gave a gasp and instinctively clutched
Lammy&rsquo;s hand. Could this be some one from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
uncle? Of course it was not he himself, for her
father had been youngish, tall and slight, with fair
hair, small feet and hands, while this man was all
of fifty, and had a rough and common look in spite
of his clothes that did not match his heavy boots and
clumsy grimy hands.</p>

<p>For a moment Bird forgot the story of her father&rsquo;s
boyhood that he had so often told her, forgot that
fifteen years and a different mother separated him
from his half-brothers, and when Mr. Lane called
her, as she tried to slip in at the side door after
Lammy, saying, &ldquo;Come here, Bird, this is your
Uncle John O&rsquo;More come from New York,&rdquo; she
could only keep from falling by an effort, and stood
still, nervously twisting her hands in the skirt of her
black frock without being able to speak a word,
while Twinkle seated himself at her feet looking
anxiously, first at the stranger, then at Mr. Lane,
with his head cocked on one side.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br />

HER UNCLE JOHN</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Got</span> a start? Didn&rsquo;t expect to see me here, did
you? else maybe you never knew you had an Uncle
John,&rdquo; said the stranger, by way of greeting, taking
Bird roughly, but not unkindly, by the shoulders and
looking her full in the face. Then, noticing how pale
she was and that her eyes were red with crying, he
let her go with a pat of his heavy hand that shook
her through and through, saying, half to her and half
to Mr. Lane, &ldquo;Go along in now and get your supper.
You look done up, and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to a bite
myself since I&rsquo;ve got to hang around over night;
been chasing round after you since morning, and
those sandwiches I got at that tumble-down ranch at
what they call the Centre were made up of last year&rsquo;s
mule-heel. They ain&rsquo;t gone further&rsquo;n here yet,&rdquo; he
added, striking his chest that was covered by a
showy scarf, emphatically.</p>

<p>Bird began to breathe more freely to know he was
going away in the morning. Her father had told her
in one of the long sleepless nights of his illness about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his two half-brothers, one in Australia, as far as he
knew, and the other in New York. Their mother
had been a strong, black-eyed, south-country lass, but
his mother, the wife of his father&rsquo;s later years, was a
gentle, fair-haired, English girl, the governess in the
family to which his father was steward. At her
death when he was a lad of about fifteen, family
differences arose, and he had gone to his mother&rsquo;s
people until he finally came to America with this
brother John.</p>

<p>John was sturdy and coarse-grained; Terence delicate
and sensitive. They soon parted, and in the
years between the artist had written occasionally to
his brother, but kept him in ignorance of his poverty.
Yet, in spite of knowing it all, Bird was bitterly disappointed
in her uncle. She built hopes about him,
for did he not live in New York, and there were
schools where painting was taught in that magical
city, also the man lived there who wanted the wall-papers.
Ah, if her uncle had only been different, he
might have asked her to visit him or perhaps even
have known the wall-paper man himself.</p>

<p>But this uncle seemed an impossibility and fairly
repelled her, so that to get out of his sight was all she
desired. Presently she went into the house, and, after
carefully dusting her plain, little, black straw hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
laying it on the sofa in the best room, she covered
her new dress with Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s gingham apron that
hung on its usual peg and fell to work at helping
Lammy with the supper.</p>

<p>Now Bird was a clever little housewife while
Lammy was very clumsy at the work, so that in a
few minutes they were both absorbed and chatting
quite cheerfully, never dreaming of the conversation
that was going on in the north porch. Only the
white-curtained windows of the best room could hear
it, and they were shut tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Lane, since the youngster&rsquo;s gone in, I
guess we might as well get right down to business.
I&rsquo;ve shown you my papers and proofs, and there&rsquo;s no
special use rubbing it into her that her father was a
dead failure clear from the start, and that the sticks
of furniture he left and the few dollars banked or
coming from his work &rsquo;ll only square up his accounts
and leave the kid on the world, so to speak. I own
I&rsquo;m clean flabbergasted myself, for I thought he was a
man of some property through his wife, for when he
wrote, his letters were chuck full of high ideas for
the girl here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua Lane fidgeted miserably on the edge of his
chair, and if ever a man longed for the presence and
ready tongue of his wife, it was he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s one way o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at it,&rdquo; he
assented after a while, &ldquo;but mebbe in some way he
didn&rsquo;t flat out so much as it looks. He never gave
an ill word to any one, and Bird here&rsquo;s as smart and
talkable and writes a fist as good as the seminary
principal over to Northboro, all through his teachin&rsquo;,
so no wonder she set a store by him. As to leavin&rsquo;
the child on the world, she&rsquo;ll never feel the hurtin&rsquo;
edge of it while mother and Joshua Lane&rsquo;s got roof
and bite. I told O&rsquo;More so, and I reckon it eased
him considerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smart, is she?&rdquo; echoed the other; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
mercy. Girls have to get a move on them nowadays
in the city, and if they can&rsquo;t start in at type-writing
or something when they&rsquo;re sixteen or so, they get
shoved out of the race as leftovers by a new lot
before they&rsquo;ve earned their ten a week. I&rsquo;ve got a
good job now, but I&rsquo;ve had to hustle for it and keep
a lively step, too. That&rsquo;s why it goes hard to lose
two days&rsquo; time on this business. I was mighty
afraid when I saw what a forsaken hole this was
that the girl might be green as the grass, and n.&nbsp;g.
altogether. No, I didn&rsquo;t mean any offence,&rdquo; he said,
as he noticed Joshua&rsquo;s face flush at his reference to
the pretty hillside village, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve never had a use
for the country. Give me streets with a push of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
people and a lively noise and trolleys going by at
night to remind you yer alive, if you don&rsquo;t sleep
straight through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, knowing nothing of the circumstances
before I left, I couldn&rsquo;t quite fix a plan,&mdash;might have
had to wait around and see to that mill property if it
hadn&rsquo;t vamoosed, but as it is, I don&rsquo;t see why Bird
shouldn&rsquo;t go right back with me to-morrow morning.
I&rsquo;ve got three lively boys besides a poor little crippled
feller,&mdash;them and the city sights &rsquo;ll cheer her up.
It&rsquo;s different from what I thought to find, and I don&rsquo;t
owe Terry any favours of purse or tongue, but I&rsquo;ve
no girls, and blood&rsquo;s thicker &rsquo;n water even though the
English streak is heatin&rsquo; to an all-through Irishman,&mdash;but
let that go. I&rsquo;ll give her some schooling
until she&rsquo;s fit age to choose her trade, or if she&rsquo;s
tasty looking, get in some good shop, and she can
ease her way along meantime in minding little Billy
or helping the woman out. For I&rsquo;d have you know
that though I&rsquo;ve a good job, and there&rsquo;s always meat
in the pot, we&rsquo;re plain people of no pretence. I&rsquo;ve
money in a land company, though, that&rsquo;ll soon give us
our own home and not so far out either but what a
gun would shoot into the Bowery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s speech poured out so rapidly that
it almost stunned Joshua Lane. When he pulled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
together, he gasped: &ldquo;Did you say that you
calkerlate to take Bird away from us and to-morrow
at that? I&rsquo;ll have to go down to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s, I
reckon, and call mother to onct,&rdquo; but as he started
from his chair &ldquo;mother&rdquo; appeared, coming up the
road in the buggy clucking vigorously to the old gray
horse, excitement written in every line of her homely,
lovable face.</p>

<p>As she pulled up the horse at the gate, an entirely
unnecessary labour as for the past ten years he had
never willingly gone past it, Joshua, wearing a white,
scared look upon his usually placid face, greeted her
with: &ldquo;Sakes alive, Lauretta Ann, I&rsquo;m wonderful
put out; it never rains but it pours; an&rsquo; &rsquo;s if there
wasn&rsquo;t enough trouble for one day, Bird&rsquo;s uncle,
John O&rsquo;More, has turned up. He&rsquo;s a rough, drivin&rsquo;,
quick-tongued sort o&rsquo; chap, like the travellin&rsquo; man
that sold us the horse-rake that had fits of balking
and tearin&rsquo; up the medder, and when I complained,
he said, says he, &lsquo;Why, certainly, I forgot it had the
plough combination,&mdash;I had oughter asked you an
extry five on it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Joshua Lane, nobody&rsquo;s going to carry
Bird off under our very noses, uncle or no uncle; I&rsquo;ll
soon settle that! But talking of pourin&rsquo; rain,&mdash;it&rsquo;s certainly
let drive on us this day, for your Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had a stroke; and though she can&rsquo;t move she can speak
her mind still, and isn&rsquo;t for lettin&rsquo; folks in or havin&rsquo;
things done for her as she ought. I&rsquo;ve left Dinah
Lucky with her, and I&rsquo;ve stopped at Doctor Jedd&rsquo;s
and told him to hurry down, but the time has come
when you&rsquo;ve just got to assert yourself willy-nilly.
It&rsquo;s you, not me, as is her eldest nephew and kin,
and while I&rsquo;m more&rsquo;n willing to do the work, you&rsquo;ve
got to show some spunk. Now jist you git into a
biled shirt and your good coat and go down and
stand off the neighbours that, now she can&rsquo;t stir, &rsquo;ll all
be wrigglin&rsquo; and slippin&rsquo; through that door like eels in
the mill sluice when the gate&rsquo;s up. I&rsquo;ll soon settle
that O&rsquo;More.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua, much relieved, obediently went into the
house, while Mrs. Lane, after looking into the kitchen
to be sure that supper was progressing, smoothed
her Sunday dress that she had donned that morning
for the funeral, opened the windows of the best room
to impress her visitor with its green carpet and
cabinet organ, and asked John O&rsquo;More to come in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mrs. Lane I take it, but I guess I&rsquo;ll stay
out here,&mdash;had enough of shut-up places in that
train to-day, besides some ladies object to smoke in
the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she could speak a word or even notice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
long cigar that was sticking out of his mouth in the
direction of his left eye, he had plunged into the
subject at the exact point where it had been dropped.
&ldquo;Now as to Bird, Mrs. Lane; your husband and I
have tongue-threshed things out, and he can repeat
the same to you. I know just how things stand, so
nuff said about what&rsquo;s past. I travel in the west and
Canada for a steady house, and I&rsquo;m away a good
deal; now Bird can be company for my wife as my
kids are all boys. I&rsquo;ll give her schoolin&rsquo;, a trade, and
a shove along on the road in a couple of years. I
wouldn&rsquo;t do less for any kin of my own, and I kind
o&rsquo; take to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want you to take her, and I reckon
she don&rsquo;t either, for&mdash;&rdquo; put in Mrs. Lane, almost
bursting with suppressed speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, one moment more, madam,&rdquo; he continued,
removing his cigar and speaking rather more
slowly, &ldquo;I judge that you object to her going to-morrow;
now I can&rsquo;t stop around here, and it&rsquo;s an
expensive trip. Seein&rsquo; the city &rsquo;ll be a change, and
she&rsquo;ll soon settle down all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want her to go at all,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane
almost shrieked; &ldquo;we want her to live with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As what, for instance?&rdquo; queried O&rsquo;More, growing
more Irish in his speech, &ldquo;a kind of a charity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
help, or had you intentions of adopting her by the
law? If so, and she wishes, I&rsquo;ll stand in the way of
nothing but a change of her name, to which I&rsquo;d
object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane was struck dumb. She had no idea of
making a servant of Bird, but on the other hand
she knew that legal adoption would mean to give
Bird a like share with her own boys, and as what
little they had, or might expect, came from her
husband&rsquo;s people, this she could not promise at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant&mdash;to treat her just like my little girl
that died&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;poor Mrs. Lane got more and
more mixed up&mdash;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked Joshua about the
adoptin&rsquo; business&mdash;it&rsquo;s so lately happened, we&rsquo;d not
got that far, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mum, I see,&rdquo; said the fat man, drawing his
lips together shrewdly, &ldquo;yourself has a warm heart,
but others, yer own boys likely, may give it a chill
some day, and then where&rsquo;s Bird? No, mum, the
girl &rsquo;ll have an easier berth with her own, I fancy,
and not have to bend her back drawin&rsquo; and fetchin&rsquo;
water, either,&mdash;we&rsquo;ve it set quite handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was said with withering sarcasm for, unfortunately,
at that moment, Bird could be seen lugging
in a heavy water bucket from the well, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
she had been warned not to do, and yet did unthinkingly,
for to-day she walked as in a dream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane saw that in reality she was helpless,
unless she appealed to Bird herself, and to rouse the
child&rsquo;s sensitive spirit she knew would be not only
foolish but wicked, so for once Lauretta Ann Lane
sat silent and with bowed head, only saying with a
choking voice, &ldquo;I will tell her after&mdash;supper&mdash;and
you&rsquo;ll let&mdash;us write&mdash;to her, I suppose, and have
her&mdash;back to visit if she gets piney for Lammy,&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
been like twin brother and sister ever since
Janey died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will that, ma&rsquo;am, and I&rsquo;ll say more; if within
the year she don&rsquo;t content herself and settle down
and grieves for yer, and yer see it clear in that time
to adopt her fair and square, and guarantee to do
by her as I will,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O&rsquo;More stretched his legs, stiff with sitting, and
jerked his half-burned cigar into the bushes, while
at the same moment Oliver and Nellis, Lammy&rsquo;s
big brothers who worked in Milltown, rode up on
their wheels and the bell rang for supper.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>No one but Bird ever knew what Mrs. Lane said
to her that night, during the sad hours that she held
the child in her arms in the great rocking-chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that had soothed to sleep three generations of Lane
babies. Perhaps it soothed poor Bird, too, only she
did not know it then; yet she fell asleep, after a
storm of crying, with her arms around Twinkle, the
terrier, as soon as Mrs. Lane had put her to bed,
promising to come back from Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s early
in the morning to awaken her, for her uncle was to
take the nine o&rsquo;clock train from the Centre.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Lane collected, in a valise, the few
clothes that made up Bird&rsquo;s wardrobe, she felt
broken-hearted indeed, but she could not but realize
that if the little girl must go, the quicker the better,
and who knew what might turn up, for Mrs. Lane
was always hopeful. But Lammy, poor boy, could
not see one bright spot in the darkness. It was with
difficulty that his father could keep the child, usually
so gentle, from flying at O&rsquo;More; he stormed and
begged and finally, completely exhausted, fled to
the stuffy attic where he fell asleep, pillowed by
some hard ears of seed corn.</p>

<p>Next morning when Bird awoke, she had forgotten
and felt much better for her long sleep, but when
she sat up and looked at the strange room, it all
came back. One thought mingled with the dread
of parting,&mdash;she was going to New York; there was
where the wall-paper man lived and people learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
things. Hope was strong in her also, and never did
she doubt for a moment but what she could win her
way and come back some day to her friends if she
could only find the right path.</p>

<p>Downstairs all was confusion. Joshua Lane had
come from Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s to take O&rsquo;More over to
the judge&rsquo;s house to sign some papers. A man had
followed him up to say Dr. Jedd felt the old lady
was worse. Mrs. Lane was giving Bird a thousand
directions and warnings that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly
remember, and in the middle of it all Lammy, looking
straight before him and dumb as an owl, his
eyes nearly closed from last night&rsquo;s crying, drove
around in the business wagon to take the travellers
to the station, four good miles away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my card, so you&rsquo;ll know where I hang
out,&rdquo; said John O&rsquo;More, as he stepped into the
wagon, holding out a bit of printed pasteboard to
Joshua Lane, &ldquo;and if you need anything in my
line, I&rsquo;ll let you in on the square.&rdquo; On one corner
was the picture of a horse&rsquo;s head, on the other a
wagon, and the letters read, &ldquo;John O&rsquo;More with
Brush &amp; Burr, Dealers in Horses, Vehicles of all
Kinds, Harness &amp; Stable Fixings.&rdquo; Then they
drove away, Bird keeping her eyes fixed on Twinkle
who Lammy had settled in the straw at their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To think she was going and I was so put
about I never asked the address,&rdquo; sighed Mrs.
Lane, adjusting her glasses and looking at the
card. &ldquo;For goodness sakes, Joshua, <em>do</em> you suppose
he&rsquo;s a horse-jockey? I sort of hoped he might
be in groceries, or coal or lumber,&mdash;something solid
and respectable. What would poor Terry say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know, Lauretta Ann,&rdquo; sighed Joshua,
whose slow nature was showing the wear, tear, and
hurry of the last few days; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s Terry&rsquo;s brother,
not ourn. It takes all kinds of fellers to make up a
world, and I <em>hev</em> met honest horse-jockeys, and then
again I haven&rsquo;t. I wished I&rsquo;d thought to ask him
the bottom price for a new chaise; ourn is so weak
every time you cross the ford I&rsquo;m afeared you&rsquo;ll spill
through the bottom into the water,&rdquo; and Joshua
turned on his heel and went in to a belated breakfast,
while his wife jerked remarks at the chickens
she made haste to feed, about the heartlessness of
all men, which she didn&rsquo;t in the least mean.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>They had ten minutes or so to wait for the train
when they reached the Centre, and, after taking
her valise to be checked and buying the ticket,
O&rsquo;More returned to the wagon for Bird. For the
first time she remembered that she had not asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
about Twinkle and perhaps he might need a ticket.
Making a brave effort to get out the name that
choked her, yet too considerate to use the plain
Mr., she said: &ldquo;Uncle John,&mdash;you won&rsquo;t mind if I
take Twinkle with me, will you? He&rsquo;s very clean
and clever; I love him dearly and he was so good
to Terry when he was sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O&rsquo;More was the bustling city man now, and
whatever sentiment had swayed him the night
before was slept away. He gave a glance at the
dog and shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a no account little yaller cur. If your
aunt will let you keep a pup, there&rsquo;s always a
litter around the stable you can pick from, though
they&rsquo;re more&rsquo;n likely to fall off the fire-escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tears came to Bird&rsquo;s eyes, but she blinked
them back; but not before Lammy saw them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep Twinkle all safe for you&mdash;till&mdash;you
come a-visiting,&rdquo; he said in a shaky voice, reading
her wish.</p>

<p>Then the train came around the curve and
stopped at the big tank to drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; called O&rsquo;More.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve forgotten my paint-box and bundle!&rdquo;
said Bird, running back to get the precious portfolio
that had been wrapped in the horse blanket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More, &ldquo;paint-box! Just
you leave that nonsense to your chum along with
the dog. You&rsquo;ve had enough of paints and painting
for your vittles; I&rsquo;m going to see you stick to
bread and meat,&rdquo; and, waving his hand good-by to
Lammy, he flung him a silver dollar, that missing
the wagon rolled in the dirt.</p>

<p>For a moment the sickening disappointment
tempted Bird to turn and run down the track,
anywhere so long as she got away; then her pride
came to her aid, and, stretching out her hands to
her playmate, she cried, &ldquo;Keep them safe for me,
oh, Lammy, please do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I will, don&rsquo;t you fret!&rdquo; he called back.</p>

<p>Then she followed her uncle quietly to the cars,
and her last glimpse, as the train entered the cut,
was of Lammy, seated in the old wagon with
Twinkle at his side, the box and the portfolio
clasped in his arms, and a brave smile on his
face.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br />

AUNT JIMMY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few minutes Lammy sat looking after the
vanishing train. Then he carefully wrapped the
paint-box and portfolio in the blanket again, and,
patting Twinkle, who was quivering with excitement
and looking into his face with a pitiful,
pleading glance, he put the dog down in the straw
again, saying, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it, old fellow; we&rsquo;ve
just got to stand it until we can fix up some way
to get her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he turned the wagon about, with much
backing and rasping of cramped wheels, the bright
silver dollar that was lying in the dirt caught his
eye. It seemed like a slap in the face when
O&rsquo;More threw it, though in his rough way he
meant well enough, and Lammy&rsquo;s first impulse
was to drive home and leave it where it had
fallen.</p>

<p>Still, after all, it was money, and to earn money
vaguely seemed to him the only way by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he could get Bird back again, for though Lammy
had a comfortable home, enough clothing, and plenty
to eat, whole dollars were as rare in his pockets
as white robins in the orchard.</p>

<p>So he picked up the shining bit of silver, wiped
it carefully on his sleeve, and, wrapping it in a
scrap of paper, opened the precious paint-box,
and tucked the coin into one of the small compartments.
It never occurred to him to spend the
money for any of the little things a boy of fourteen
always wants, and he quite forgot that his
knife had only half of one blade left. The money
was for Bird, and from that moment the paint-box,
which was to spend some months in his lower
bureau drawer in company with his best jacket
and two prizes won at school, became a savings
bank.</p>

<p>Lammy stopped at the &ldquo;Centre&rdquo; druggist&rsquo;s for
some medicine for Aunt Jimmy, and while he was
waiting for the mixture, he had to undergo a running
fire of questions concerning his aunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;spell&rdquo; from
the people who came in from all sections for their
mail, as this store was also the post-office and there
was as yet no rural free-delivery system to deprive
the community of its daily trade in news.</p>

<p>Now Aunt Jimmy, otherwise Jemima Lane, occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
an unusual position in the neighbourhood and was
a personage of more than common importance. In
the first place she was a miser, which is always interesting,
as a miser is thought to be a sort of magician
whose money is supposed to lie hidden in the chimney
and yet increase as by double cube root; then
she owned ten acres of the best land for small fruits&mdash;strawberries,
raspberries, currants, and peaches&mdash;in
the state. The ground was on the southern slope
of Laurel Ridge, and though it was shielded in such a
way that the March sun did not tempt the peach
blossoms out before their time, yet Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
strawberries were always in the Northboro market a
full week ahead of the other native fruit.</p>

<p>Of course there was nothing particularly strange in
this interest, as many people coveted the land. The
odd part that concerned the gossips was that Aunt
Jimmy had three able-bodied nephews, of which
Joshua Lane was eldest, all farmers struggling along
on poorish land, while she, though seventy-five years
old, insisted upon running her fruit farm and house
entirely alone, hiring Poles or Hungarians, who could
speak no English, to till and gather the crops, instead
of going shares with her own kin. In fact, until a
few years back, no one, man, woman, or child, except
little Janey Lane, had ever got beyond the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
door. Then when she died, Aunt Jimmy had opened
her house and heart to Joshua Lane&rsquo;s wife, and ever
since, that dear, motherly soul had done all that she
could for the queer, lonely old woman, in spite of the
fact that the gossips said she did it from selfish
motives.</p>

<p>Joshua Lane was very sensitive about this talk and
would have held aloof like his two brothers, who lived
beyond the Centre, one of whom had a sick wife and
was too lazy to more than scratch half rations from
his land, while the other had once given the old lady
some unwise advice about pruning peach trees, and
had been forbidden inside the gate under pain of
being cut off with a &ldquo;china button,&rdquo; Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
pet simile for nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Joshua, however, was gossip proof, and, tossing
her head, had publicly declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-going to
keep the old lady from freezin&rsquo;, burnin&rsquo;, or starvin&rsquo;
herself to death jest so far &rsquo;s I&rsquo;m able, accordin&rsquo; to
scripture and the feelings that&rsquo;s in me, and if that&rsquo;s
&lsquo;undue influence,&rsquo; so be it! I shan&rsquo;t discuss the subject
with anybody but the Lord,&rdquo; and she never did.</p>

<p>Many a meal of hot cooked food she took to the
old woman to replace the crackers and cheese of her
own providing. It was not that Aunt Jimmy meant
to be mean, but she had lived so long alone that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had gotten out of the habits of human beings. She
certainly looked like a lunatic when she went about
the place superintending her men, clad in a short
skirt, a straw sunbonnet, and rubber boots, merely
adding in the winter a man&rsquo;s army overcoat and cape
that she had picked up cheap; but the lawyer who
had come down from Northboro a year before to
make her will said he had never met a clearer mind
outside of the profession, for she had Dr. Jedd testify
that she was of sound mind, and a second physician
from Northboro swear that Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s wits
were also in good order.</p>

<p>Shortly after this she had given it out quietly that,
though Joshua Lane was the only one of her kin that
was worth a box of matches, yet they would share
and share alike, as she didn&rsquo;t believe in stirring up
strife among brothers by showing favour.</p>

<p>Then everybody expected Mrs. Lane would lessen
her attentions, but as often happens everybody was
mistaken.</p>

<p>Of course the good woman could not help thinking
once in a while what a fine thing it would be if some
day her elder boys could work the fruit farm (Lammy
she never thought of as working at anything) instead
of delving in a shop at Milltown, but she put the idea
quickly from her. However, it would keep coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
back all that night after Terence O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s funeral
when she watched with the old lady, while poor Bird
slept her grief-spent sleep before her journey.</p>

<p>If the fruit farm could ever be hers, she would
adopt Bird without hesitation, for the little lady-child
had crept into the empty spot that Janey had left in
her big mother heart and filled it in a way that greatly
astonished her.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Lammy finally secured the medicine and jogged
homeward, thinking, all the time thinking about Bird.
He knew that people said he was stupid, and yet he
also felt that he could learn as well as any one if they
would only let him pick his own way a little. His
father wanted him to be a carpenter, his mother
thought that too rough, and that he was still a baby
and some day perhaps he might be a clerk.</p>

<p>But Lammy himself, as he looked into the future,
saw only the whirling wheels of the machinery at
Milltown, or the wonders of the locomotive works
that he had once visited at Northboro. That was
why he was always day-dreaming and looking in the
air. Of course it was very stupid and dumb of him
not to tell his parents, but Bird&rsquo;s was the only ear
that had ever heard his thoughts.</p>

<p>All that day he stayed about the place at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
keeping the fire in and doing the chores, for his
mother&rsquo;s time was divided between her aunt&rsquo;s and
straightening things at Bird&rsquo;s old home, and his
father was up in the back lots planting corn.
Toward night, as he was sitting on the steps having
brought back Twinkle who had run to his old home
in search of his little mistress, Mrs. Lane bustled in,
mystery and importance written on her face. Spying
Lammy, she beckoned him to follow her into the
kitchen, then, carefully closing the doors, putting
Twinkle in the closet and the cat out of the window,
as if they could carry tales, she unfastened her bonnet
and collar and settled herself in the rocking-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samuel Lane,&rdquo; she began solemnly, shaking her
forefinger and making the boy quake at the unused
title, while his eyes opened wide in wonder, &ldquo;No, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
<em>that</em>; Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s <em>much</em> more comfortable, and I
suspect she&rsquo;s going to pick up again after scaring us
well, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be home, but she said private
words to me this afternoon that if I do keep quite
to myself, I&rsquo;ll burst, I know, and maybe get a headache
spell that&rsquo;ll lay me by a day and upset everything.
Now, Samuel, I&rsquo;ve found as far as givin&rsquo;
messages you&rsquo;re told to carry, you&rsquo;re as good as nobody,
so I reckon you&rsquo;ll be tight sealed on something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that you&rsquo;re bid to keep close and forget maybe for
some years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it about Bird?&rdquo; asked Lammy, suddenly jumping
up and fixing his big, gray eyes on his mother&rsquo;s
face with a gaze that made her nervous, for she well
knew that there was something in this pet son of hers
that was a little beyond her comprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not about Bird,&mdash;that is, not straight, though
another way it may have a lot to do with her; it all
depends. Listen, Samuel!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon Aunt Jimmy waked up, and, seeing
me sitting by the window croshayin&rsquo;,&mdash;true I was
making a bungle of the tidy, not feelin&rsquo; like workin&rsquo;
(but she hates, same &rsquo;s I do, for watchers to set idle
looking ready to jump at a body like a cat does at a
mouse hole),&mdash;she says, says she, her voice comin&rsquo; back
steady, &lsquo;Set nearer, Lauretta Ann Lane, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
tell you somethin&rsquo; no one else need ever know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drew up all of a flutter, of course. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a
good woman, Lauretta Ann,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ve
never poked and pried, or shown desires for what&rsquo;s
another&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve worked hard to keep me livin&rsquo;,
which I&rsquo;ve done to my satisfaction beyond my
expectations.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I burst out cryin&rsquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t help it; for I never
thought she set any store by me, and I felt guilty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
about wishes I&rsquo;d had last night and had fed with
thoughts inwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush up, now, and don&rsquo;t spoil all by pretendin&rsquo;,&rsquo;
she ran on; &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;d like to have my farm,
though not a day before I&rsquo;m done with it. <em>I&rsquo;ll</em> credit
you that. It&rsquo;s natural and proper and I&rsquo;m glad to
have interest took in it, likewise I&rsquo;ve said I&rsquo;d share
and share alike between my nephews, which I intend;
but listen, Lauretta Ann, for there&rsquo;s ways of circumventin&rsquo;
that suits me, <em>I&rsquo;ve left you the farm for your
own</em>; moreover, I&rsquo;ve fixed it so there&rsquo;ll be no talk and
no one&rsquo;ll know it but you. You think I&rsquo;m crazy, I
guess, and that you couldn&rsquo;t get the farm unbeknown,
nohow. Just wait and see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she asked me to draw her a cup of tea, and
when I went to fetch that battered old pewter tea-pot
she&rsquo;s used I reckon these fifty years, &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t in its
place, but on her mantel-shelf, and when I reached
up to take it down she said, &lsquo;Leave that be and take
the chiney one; its work&rsquo;s over for me and we&rsquo;re both
takin&rsquo; a rest;&rsquo; then she dozed off after the very first
sup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Lammy, who was now leaning on
her knees with his hands behind her head and drawing
it close, while his eyes glowed like coals, &ldquo;if&mdash;if
you ever get the farm&mdash;will&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring Bird back?&rdquo; she finished for him, hugging
him close. &ldquo;Yes, I will, and you shall both go to
school to Northboro, too; but mind you, Samuel, no
crowdin&rsquo; Aunt Jimmy, and it may be years yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now bustle round and help me cook up something,
for I must go back to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s before
seven, as Mis&rsquo; Jedge o&rsquo; Probate Ricker is the only one
I&rsquo;ll trust to spell me, for Dinah Lucky&rsquo;s mush in a
bowl when the village folks smooth her down with
their palarver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lammy flew about, sifting flour, skimming milk,
or rattling cups and saucers, and it was not quite
dark, supper over, and every dish washed, when he
went back to the porch steps and whispered the precious
hope to Twinkle, who raised one ear and his lip
together as much as if he understood and cautioned
silence. Then the boy began day-dreaming anew,
but this time his mind, instead of following flying
wheels, was busy weeding strawberry plants and carefully
picking raspberries, so as not to crush them, while
Bird stood by and watched. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he startled himself
by saying aloud, &ldquo;the first thing I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;ll be to
divide off a root of those red pineys and plant it up
on the hill, so Bird &rsquo;ll find it next spring all in blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>A few days later when Dr. Jedd and all the neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
were convinced that Aunt Jimmy would be out
in the garden again by raspberry time, with good
chance of another ten years, and Mrs. Lane had
made indoors more comfortable than it had been for
years by a thorough cleaning and renovating, the
strange old lady again upset all their calculations and
died. Then in due time the lawyer from Northboro
sent letters to the three nephews and their families,
to Dr. Jedd, to the minister of the First
Congregational Church, and to the superintendent of
the new School of Industrial Art of Northboro, to
meet on a certain Friday afternoon at Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
house to hear the will read.</p>

<p>Once more was the entire community involved
in a guessing match. The summoning of the kin
was a matter of course, and usually took place immediately,
so that the lawyer was evidently carrying
out special directions in delaying the matter for
more than a week, but as to what the doctor, the
minister, and the teacher from Northboro could
possibly have to do in the matter was a mystery
that not even the fertile brain of Mrs. Slocum could
settle, either for good nor evil.</p>

<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be that Aunt Jimmy had left these
three outside men anything, for it was known that
she only employed Dr. Jedd because she couldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
help it, that she hadn&rsquo;t been to church for five years
because the minister had preached a sermon against
avarice and the vanity of hoarding money, and as
to the Northboro teacher it was positively certain that
she had never even seen him, for he was a stranger
in these parts, having recently been sent from New
York, to take charge of the school, by a wealthy
man who had been influential in founding it and
whose country place was on the farther edge of the
town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane was as much in the dark as any one and
did not hesitate to say so, while excitement ran so
high that on this particular Friday afternoon the
women sat in their fore-room windows overlooking
the village street with the expectant air of waiting
for a passing procession.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dr. Jedd, Mrs. Judge of Probate Ricker, and
the minister&rsquo;s wife were privileged to attend the
reading by courtesy for reason of being their
husband&rsquo;s wives, and cakes had been baked and
several plans made to waylay them separately on
their divers routes home to drink a cup of tea, that
every detail might be gleaned for comparing of notes
afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see whether Lauretta Ann Lane&rsquo;s
cake is dough or fruit loaf,&rdquo; sniffed Mrs. Slocum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
angrily, drawing in her head suddenly from the third
fruitless inspection of the road that she had made in
fifteen minutes and giving it a smart bump against
the sash as she did so. &ldquo;Either the folks is late, or
they&rsquo;re gone around the back road, and if so, why?
I&rsquo;d just like you to tell me,&rdquo; she snapped at Hope
Snippin, the meek little village dressmaker who,
drawn over as if she had a perpetual stitch in her
side, was remaking a skirt for the lady of the
house and felt very much discouraged, as it had
been turned once before, at the possibility of making
it look startlingly new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve stopped down to the Lane&rsquo;s and
have walked around the meadow path,&rdquo; ventured
Hope Snippin. &ldquo;The other day when I was fixin&rsquo;
up Mis&rsquo; Lane&rsquo;s black gown, changing the buttons
and such like to turn it from just Sunday best to
mourning, I heard her tell Mis&rsquo; Jedd that, as there
was no convenience for gettin&rsquo; up a proper meal
down to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s, seein&rsquo; as nothing must be
touched until the will was read, she&rsquo;d asked all the
folks concerned to dinner&mdash;a roast-beef dinner
with custards&mdash;at her house so&rsquo;s they could be
comfortable and stable their teams, and then walk
right around short cut to the other house after. You
see the two farms meets the road separate, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
two heels of a horseshoe, and then join by going back
of the doctor&rsquo;s hill woods. My father was sayin&rsquo;
last night if those two farms <em>and</em> the wood lot went
together, they&rsquo;d be something worth while,&rdquo; and Miss
Snippin smiled pleasantly as if she thought she had
propitiated Mrs. Slocum by her news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you knew all the while they wouldn&rsquo;t come
by here and never told me, though seein&rsquo; me slavin&rsquo;
over that cake,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Slocum. &ldquo;I wish
you&rsquo;d mind your work closer; you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; that
front breadth up stain out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it runs clean through,&rdquo; pleaded the dressmaker,
miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; Mrs. Slocum muttered to
herself, not heeding the protest, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s made sure of
that farm, or she wouldn&rsquo;t risk the cost of a roast
dinner for a dozen folks if she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Meanwhile this dinner had been eaten and the
party, headed by the lawyer and the teacher, had
gone through the sweet June fields to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
house and seated themselves upon the stiff-backed,
fore-room chairs that were ranged in a long row, as
if the company expected to play &ldquo;Go to Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside, the bees were humming in the syringa
bushes while the cat-birds and robins, unmolested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
were holding a festival in the great strawberry bed,
for to-day there was no one to see that the birds
&ldquo;kept moving&rdquo; after the usual custom, as the hired
man on returning from taking eggs to market had
gone to sleep in the hay barn, knowing that the stern
voice of the old lady in rubber boots and sunbonnet
would not disturb his dreams.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hem,&rdquo; the lawyer cleared his throat and read the
usual preliminaries about &ldquo;last will and testament,
sound mind,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;paying of just debts,&rdquo; etc., in a
clear but rapid voice that grew gradually solemn and
important, until, as the pith of the matter was
reached, every word was separated from its neighbour,
and the buzzing of a fly on the window-pane
seemed an unbearable noise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give and bequeath to Amelia, the wife of
William Jedd, doctor of medicine in this town, the
sum of two thousand dollars, because I think she
may need it owing to her husband&rsquo;s slack way of
collecting bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jedd, who had for a moment looked radiant,
quickly cast down her eyes after a frightened glance
at her husband who was, with apparent difficulty,
refraining from laughter as he looked crosswise at
the minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I give and bequeath to Sarah Ann, wife of Joel
Stevens, minister of the First Congregational Church,
a like sum of two thousand dollars because she is
sure to need it, this being twice the amount that he
once desired me to give to foreign missions. If he
still holds to his views of avarice and hoarding,
he will doubtless be able to persuade her to share
his ideas as to its use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the minister&rsquo;s turn now to look red and
confused, while his wife&rsquo;s face expressed her views
on the subject beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give and bequeath to the Trust Fund of the
School of Industrial Art in Northboro the sum of
$10,000, the income therefrom to be applied to the
board and teaching of two girls each year who cannot
afford to pay, for the reason that I think a girl
is usually worth two boys if she has a chance, and I
don&rsquo;t like to see our best girls running to the big
cities for schooling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I direct that my fruit farm of ten acres, more
or less, with the adjoining one hundred acres of
meadow and woodlands, and all buildings and fixtures,
other than household furniture, appertaining
thereto, shall be sold at public auction within six
months of my death, and that the cash proceeds be
divided between my three nephews, share and share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
alike, I holding the hope that one of them will be
the purchaser. I also direct that the pieces of
household furniture mentioned in the enclosed
memorandum shall be divided between the wives
of my three nephews by the drawing of lots, and I
charge that all other furnishings not mentioned in this
paper, being of no value except to myself, shall be
destroyed either by burning or burying in the
swamp bog-hole according to their character, as I
don&rsquo;t wish them scattered about for the curiosity
of the idle, of which this town has its full share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Making one exception to the above, I give to
my dear niece by marriage, Lauretta Ann, wife of
Joshua Lane, in token of my respect for her, my
old pewter tea-pot that, as she knows, I have
treasured as having laid buried in the garden
through the War of Independence and had in daily
use for years, hoping she will cherish it and by like
daily use hold me in constant remembrance by the
sight of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture no one dared look up, for all felt
the cruelty of the gift after Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s years of
service, and the poor woman herself merely tightened
her grasp upon the chair arms, but she could
not prevent the sickening sense of disappointment
that crept over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hereby appoint my nephew, Joshua Lane, as
my sole executor, directing that he be paid the sum
of $1000 from my estate for his services, desiring him
to carry on the fruit business for the current year,
the profits to be added to my estate. (Here followed
special instructions.) If there be any residue after
paying to the before-named legacies, I direct that
he divide it equally between himself and his two
brothers, and I hope that all concerned may feel the
same pleasure in hearing this testament that I have
had in making it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the lawyer stopped reading there was a
pause, and then a rush of voices, congratulations
and condolences mingled. That he had made an
error in summoning Dr. Jedd and the minister
instead of their wives was plain.</p>

<p>The two brothers, who cared nothing for the
fruit farm except its cash price and had been too
indolent to bother about the matter or go to see
their aunt except in fruit time, assumed importance
and talked about wounded pride and the injustice
of having but one executor. The school superintendent,
an Englishman of fifty or so who had
received his art training at South Kensington and
brought it to market in America, confused by his
surroundings, but of course pleased at the gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by which his school benefited, made haste to leave,
feeling that he was intruding in a gathering where
a family storm was brewing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe there&rsquo;s something <em>in</em> the tea-pot,&rdquo; suggested
the minister&rsquo;s wife, hopefully, &ldquo;else I can&rsquo;t
think she knew her own mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s surely something in it,&rdquo; echoed Mrs.
Dr. Jedd.</p>

<p>The lawyer, who himself had thought this possible,
went upstairs, and took down the battered bit
of pewter from the best bedroom shelf, where it had
remained since the day Mrs. Lane had placed it
there at Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s request, opened it, shook it,
and held it toward the eager group,&mdash;it was absolutely
empty!</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane stretched out her hand for the legacy,
but her husband grasped her arm and asserting
himself for the first time in his married life, said:
&ldquo;Lauretta Ann, don&rsquo;t you tech it; it&rsquo;ll go down
in the swamp hole with the other trash for all of
you. I&rsquo;ll not have you a-harbourin&rsquo; a viper. I&rsquo;ll
do my lawful duty, but, by crickey, I&rsquo;ll not have
you put upon no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This very ambiguous speech so impressed the
hearers that it was reported that &ldquo;Joshua Lane
wasn&rsquo;t tied to Lauretta&rsquo;s apron-strings and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hold his own equal to anybody,&rdquo; which had been
seriously doubted, while the news was a surprise
and disappointment to every one but Mrs. Slocum,
who said, &ldquo;Dough! I told you so,&rdquo;&mdash;and actually
cut a big slice of cake for Hope Snippin to take
home for tea.</p>

<p>As for Lammy he seemed dazed for a while,
and then set to work daily with his father on the
fruit farm, so that he might earn the tickets to
send to Bird when hot weather and the time for
her visit came. His mother noticed that he did
not gaze about as much as usual, and, while he
was picking berries for market, he said to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll snake a root of those red pineys for Bird
anyhow before the auction, &rsquo;long in November, and
maybe before then something &rsquo;ll turn up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br />

A CAGED BIRD</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the high banks of the cut shut off Lammy
from Bird&rsquo;s sight, she followed her uncle into the
car, vainly trying to blink back her tears. He,
however, did not notice them; but, putting her valise
on a seat, told her she had better sit next to the
window so that she could amuse herself by looking
out, as it would be two hours before they changed
cars at New Haven, and then, taking another seat
for himself, pulled his hat over his eyes and
promptly fell asleep.</p>

<p>At first the poor child was content to sit quite
still and rest, trying to realize who and where she
was. The changes of the past two weeks had been
so sudden that she did not yet fully realize them.
Beginning with the day when her father, all full
of hope, had been soaked by the rain in walking
back from Northboro, where he had gone to buy
materials for beginning his work for the wall-paper
man, and caught the deadly cold, until now when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
she was leaving the only friends she had ever
known, seemed either a whole lifetime or a dream
from which she must awake.</p>

<p>But as the train flew on and the familiar places
one by one were lost in the distance, little by little
the bare cold truth came to her. Not only was she
going to a strange place to live among strangers,
but the hope that had comforted her the previous
night had been swept away when her uncle had
refused to let her bring her paint-box, and she
knew by the contemptuous way he spoke that he
was even more set against her father&rsquo;s work than
their farming neighbours had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; thought the brave, lonely little
heart, &ldquo;I simply <em>must</em> learn somehow, and perhaps
my aunt and cousins may be different and
help me to persuade Uncle John to let me go on
with drawing at the school he sends me to, for
I heard him tell Mrs. Lane that I should go to
school.&rdquo; Then Bird began to imagine what the
aunt and cousins would be like, and what sort of
a house they would live in. She thought the house
would be brick or stone like some in Northboro,
and she did not expect that there would be a very
big garden, perhaps only at the back with a little
strip at the sides and in front, but then that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hold enough flowers for her to draw so that she need
not forget the way in which Terry had taught her
to do it from life, and even if she had no paints and
only bits of paper and a pencil, she could work a
little out of the way up in her room so as not to
annoy her uncle and yet not quite give up. That
she was determined she would never do, for Bird
had, in addition to a talent that was in every way
greater than her father&rsquo;s, something that came from
her mother&rsquo;s family and that he had wholly lacked,&mdash;perseverance,
a thing that people are apt to call
obstinacy when they do not sympathize with its
object.</p>

<p>So busy was she with castle-building that she
was quite surprised when the brakeman called:
&ldquo;New Haven! Last stop. Change cars for New
York and Boston. Passengers all out!&rdquo; and her
uncle jumped up, flushed and stupid with sleep
and bundled her out of the train into the station
restaurant &ldquo;to snatch a bite of dinner&rdquo; before
they went on.</p>

<p>Now Bird, being a perfectly healthy child, even
though overwrought and tired, was hungry and
gladly climbed up on one of the high stools that
flanked the lunch counter, while her uncle gathered
a sandwich, two enormous doughnuts, and a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of a mince pie on one plate and pushed it toward
her saying: &ldquo;Tea or coffee? You&rsquo;d better fill up
snug, for we won&rsquo;t be home until well after dinnertime,&rdquo;
then John O&rsquo;More proceeded to cool his
own coffee by pouring it from cup to saucer and
back again with much noise and slopping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;d rather have milk,&rdquo; answered Bird,
rescuing the sandwich from under the pie and
making a great effort not to stare at her uncle,
who had begun by stuffing half a doughnut into
his mouth and pouring the larger part of a cup
of coffee after it before he swallowed, so that his
cheeks bulged, his eyes seemed about to pop from
their sockets, and beads of sweat stood on his
forehead, while the next moment he was shovelling
up great mouthsful of baked beans and ramming
them down with cucumber pickles, very much
as she had seen Lammy charging his father&rsquo;s
old muzzle-loading shot-gun when going to hunt
woodchucks.</p>

<p>Though sometimes the food at home had not
been any too plentiful, Bird&rsquo;s parents had always
been particular about her manners at table. She
had had their example before her and was naturally
dainty in her own ways, so that her uncle&rsquo;s gorging
gave her another shock, and unconsciously she began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to pick at her food like a veritable feathered
bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country ain&rsquo;t what it&rsquo;s cracked up to be,&rdquo;
remarked O&rsquo;More, when he was able to speak. &ldquo;I
thought country girls was always fat and rosy and
ate hearty. Just wait until you get to New York
and see my kids stoke in the vittles; it&rsquo;ll learn you
what it means to eat right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Express train for New York, stopping at Bridgeport
and Stamford only,&rdquo; called a man through the
open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; shouted O&rsquo;More, wedging in another
doughnut, throwing the pay to the waiter
and seizing a handful of toothpicks from a glass
on the counter, and before Bird had but half
finished the sandwich and milk, she found herself
on the train again.</p>

<p>The second part of the journey passed more
cheerfully, for all along at the east side of the
road were beautiful glimpses of the Sound and
silvery creeks and inlets came up to the track itself.</p>

<p>Bird had never before seen the sea, or any river
greater than the mill stream, and she exclaimed in
delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the looks of salt water, do you? Then
you&rsquo;re going to an A 1 place to see it. New York&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
an island, and you only have to go to the edge
anywhere to see water all round, not forsaken
lookin&rsquo; empty water like this either, but full of
ships and boats and push. Down at the far end
of the town is Battery Park, smash on to the
water, and there&rsquo;s sea air and seats in it and music
summer nights, along with a building full of live
swimmin&rsquo; fishes that little Billy&rsquo;s crazed over goin&rsquo; to
see. Oh, you&rsquo;ll find sport in the city for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is little Billy?&rdquo; asked Bird, feeling that she
was called upon to say something, and now realizing
that she knew nothing about the cousins she was to
meet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Billy? Oh, he&rsquo;s the youngest of the four
boys. Tom, he&rsquo;s the eldest, and a wild hawk; he&rsquo;s
got a rovin&rsquo; job, and he seldom turns up lest he&rsquo;s in
trouble, but for all that his mother&rsquo;s crazed after him.
Jack, he&rsquo;s next, seventeen, and fine and sleek and
smart with the tongue, and keeps the clean coat of a
gentleman; he&rsquo;s in a clerking job, but he goes to
night school, and he&rsquo;ll be somebody. Larry&rsquo;s fifteen,
and he&rsquo;s just quit school and got a place helping a
trainer on the race-track; he&rsquo;s minded to make
money quick, and thinks that&rsquo;s the road, which I
don&rsquo;t. Then little Billy,&mdash;he&rsquo;s turning six, and he&rsquo;s
worth more&rsquo;n the whole lot together to me, if he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
only a four-year size and hops with a crutch. Ah,
but he&rsquo;s got the head for thinkin&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;s every way
off from the rest of us, pale and yellow-haired, while
the others are coloured like sloes and crows&rsquo; wings in
the eyes and hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As O&rsquo;More spoke his whole face softened and
lightened up, and it was plain to see that little Billy
filled the soft spot that is in every heart if people
only have the eyes to see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until little Billy was turned three he was as
pretty as an angel,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and sturdy as
any other child. Then come a terrible hot summer,&mdash;oh,
I tell you it was fierce; you couldn&rsquo;t draw a
breath in the rooms, and so the missis she fixed a
bed for Billy out on the fire-escape and used to take
him there to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird was just about to ask what sort of a place a
fire-escape was, for this was the second time her
uncle had mentioned it that day having said that if
she had a dog, it would likely fall from it, but he
talked so quickly that she forgot again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As luck had it, one night the wind come up cool,
and, the woman bein&rsquo; dead tired, never woke up to
notice it, and in the morning little Billy set up a terrible
cry, for when he tried to get up he couldn&rsquo;t, for
the wind had checked the sweat and stiffened his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
leg, as it were. Of course we had a big time and
had in full a dozen doctors, and some said one thing
and some another, but they all give it the one name
&lsquo;the infant paralysis.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctors they wanted him to go to the &rsquo;ospital
and have the leg shut into a frame and all that, but I
said &rsquo;twas a shame to torment him, and I&rsquo;d have him
let be till he could say for himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman takes him awful hard, though, as if
he was a reproach to her for not wakin&rsquo; up, which is
no sense, for what be&rsquo;s to be, be&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; which
shiftless argument Bird afterward found was her
uncle&rsquo;s answer to many things that could have been
bettered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Billy will like me,&rdquo; said Bird, half to herself
after a few minutes&rsquo; silence; &ldquo;somehow I think
I like him already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do that and act well by him, I buy you a
hat with the longest feather on Broadway for your
Christmas,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More, grasping her slender
fingers and almost crushing them in his burst of
enthusiasm. &ldquo;But whist a minute, girl, for we&rsquo;re
most home now. If the woman,&mdash;I mean my missis,
your Aunt Rosy,&mdash;is offish just at the start, don&rsquo;t get
down-hearted, for you see as she don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;m
bringing you, she may be&mdash;well&mdash;a trifle startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
like. She&rsquo;ll soon settle down and take what be&rsquo;s to
be straight enough,&rdquo; and with this rather discouraging
remark the train crossed the Harlem River and
entered the long tunnel that is apt to cast a gloom
over every one&rsquo;s first entrance to New York, even
when they are bent on pleasure and not sad and
lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in now,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More in a few minutes, as
the echo of the close walls ceased and the train slid
across a maze of tracks into an immense building
with a glass roof like a greenhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grand Central Station&mdash;all out,&rdquo; called a brakeman,
and Bird found herself part of a crowd of men,
women, children, and red-capped porters moving
toward a paved street, full of carriages, wagons,
trucks, electric cars, besides many sort of vehicles
that she had never seen before, coming, going, dashing
here and there in confusion, while on every side
there was a wall of houses, and below the earth was
upturned and trenched, not a bit of grass or tree to
be seen anywhere, and the sky, oh, so far away and
small. Bird almost fell as she stumbled blindly
along toward a trolley car after the uncle, for what
could seem more unreal to this little wild thrush from
the country lane, with song in her throat, and love
of beauty and colour born in her heart, than Forty-second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Street in the middle of the first warm summer
afternoon?</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>The car they boarded went through another short
tunnel, and on every side could be heard the noise
of hammers or drilling in the rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a stone quarry?&rdquo; asked Bird, innocently,
not understanding, and wondering why the near-by
passengers smiled as her uncle replied: &ldquo;Lord bless
yer! no; it&rsquo;s the subway, a road below ground they&rsquo;re
building to let out folks from where they work to
where there&rsquo;s room to live; there&rsquo;s such push here
below town there&rsquo;s little room for sitting, let alone
sleeping. Oh, but it&rsquo;s a fine city is New York, all the
same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next a broad avenue with a jumble of old, low
shops and fine new buildings side by side; still Bird
looked anxiously out for some place where it seemed
possible that people might live and found none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s 2&mdash;th Street where we land,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More,
presently looking up, and when the car had stopped,
Bird found herself walking along a sidewalk between
another wall of buildings without gardens, while the
heat of the first warm day rising from the pavement
made her dizzy, and she asked, &ldquo;Is it far from here
to where you live, Uncle John?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, right close by, only a few steps farther.
We&rsquo;re facing east now and down yonder half a dozen
blocks is the river, the same as we crossed coming in
saving a turn in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting tired, ain&rsquo;t yer? Well, it&rsquo;s been a long
day for us, and I&rsquo;m mighty glad to be gettin&rsquo; to a
homelike place myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you live right by the water, and is there any
garden?&rdquo; Bird continued, a feeling of nameless
dread creeping over her as she saw nothing but buildings
still closing in on all sides; even a blacksmith&rsquo;s
shop, from which a spirited pair of horses were coming
with newly shod polished hoofs, seemed strange
and out of place. Then there were more poor looking
buildings, and a great stable with many men
standing about and horses being constantly driven in
and out to show the people who waited on the curbstone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the river, and do I have a garden,&rdquo; he echoed,
laughing heartily. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m one o&rsquo; the
millionnaires you read about in the papers, my girl?
Do I keep an automobile and eat at the Waldorf-Astoria?&rdquo;
and then, seeing that Bird could not understand
the comparison, he patted her good-naturedly
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>As they passed the stable quite a number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
men spoke to her uncle, but instead of resenting it as
she expected, he joked and laughed and seemed very
glad to see them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;Horse&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s out of
there my job is,&rdquo; he said to Bird, pointing over his
shoulder at the stable, &ldquo;for half the time I&rsquo;m over
the country from Kentucky to Canada picking up
horses, and the other half of the time I&rsquo;m helping
to sell them out again, so I live as near by as may be
for convenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Bird&rsquo;s heart sunk still farther, for in the
prim New England town where she was born and
bred a Puritan, a horse-dealer meant either some
oversharp farmer who could outwit his neighbours or
a roving fellow, half gypsy, half tramp, of very ill
repute, who went about from town to town buying
and selling animals who mostly had something the
matter with them that had to be concealed by lying.</p>

<p>John O&rsquo;More, striding on ahead, did not notice her
expression, nor would he have understood if he had
read her thoughts, for he was perfectly satisfied with
himself and everything else in his surroundings, except
the fact of little Billy&rsquo;s lameness, and for a man
of his class he was roughly honest and good-hearted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where!&rdquo; he said at last, turning into the
doorway of a tall building with one door and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
windows. The square vestibule was dusty and had a
ragged mat in the centre, while on one side were ten
letter-boxes in a double row, with a bell knob and
speaking-tube, as O&rsquo;More explained, over each.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your house? It seems pretty big,&rdquo; said
Bird, wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One floor of it is,&rdquo; he answered, laughing again;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;a flat house,&rsquo; because each tenant
lives flat on one floor, with conveniences at hand and
no water to carry, which beats the country all out,&rdquo;
he added slyly. &ldquo;See, I&rsquo;ll but touch the bell and
the door &rsquo;ll open itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he suited the action to the word, the door
opening to reveal a narrow, dark hall with a
flight of steep stairs covered with a shabby red
carpet.</p>

<p>As Bird groped her way up, one, two, three flights,
fairly gasping for breath in the close, hot place, she
stumbled against groups of children who were sitting
or playing school on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lighter near the top; that&rsquo;s why I choose
it,&rdquo; called her uncle, himself puffing and blowing as
he climbed. &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; and he pushed open a
door into an inner hall, and then another into a sort
of sitting room where a tall, red-haired woman, clad
in a collarless calico sack was sewing on a machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
while a pile of showy summer silks and muslins was
lying on a chair beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Rosie, old woman; here&rsquo;s Bird O&rsquo;More,
Terry&rsquo;s orphan, that I brought back to stop a bit
until we see where we&rsquo;re at,&rdquo; and he gave his wife
a knowing wink as much as to say, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s
sudden on you, but let her down as easy as you
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;old woman,&rdquo; who was perhaps forty, or at
most forty-five, glanced up, and then, either not understanding
or pretending not to, her face flushed as
she jerked out, her eyes flashing, &ldquo;Well, if you ain&rsquo;t
the aggravatment of men, John O&rsquo;More, to bring
company just when I&rsquo;ve got Mame Callahan&rsquo;s trou-sew
to finish, and she gettin&rsquo; married next week, and
Billy bein&rsquo; that cantankerous with cryin&rsquo; to go over
to the park or down to see them fishes that my
head&rsquo;s ready to split,&rdquo; she whimpered.</p>

<p>With all his will the man cowered before her
tongue, and in spite of her own pain Bird&rsquo;s womanly
little heart pitied him. She saw the piled-up garments
and knew at once that her aunt was a dressmaker,
and her gentle breeding led her to say the
one thing that could have averted an explosion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Rose, I could take Billy to see the fish or
something if you&rsquo;ll tell me the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I figured on when I brought her,&rdquo;
said O&rsquo;More, greatly relieved, and quickly following
the lead; &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d often spoke of gettin&rsquo; a
girl from the Sisters, and that&rsquo;s why I brought Bird
instead of leavin&rsquo; her to slave fer strangers,&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; answered Mrs. O&rsquo;More, at least somewhat
pacified, &ldquo;Billy&rsquo;s fastened in his chair on the
fire-escape; she&rsquo;d better go there and sit with him a
while until it&rsquo;s supper-time. It&rsquo;s too late for them
to go traipsing around the streets to-night. Can you
do anything useful?&rdquo; she said, fixing her sharp,
greenish eyes on Bird, who tried to gather her wits
together as she answered, &ldquo;I can make coffee, and
toast, and little biscuits, and two kinds of cake, and&mdash;&rdquo;
then she hesitated and stopped, for she was going to
say &ldquo;do fractions, write, read French a little, and
draw and paint,&rdquo; but she felt as if these last items
would count against her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said her aunt again, this time more
emphatically, &ldquo;I guess you done well to bring her,
Johnny. Turned thirteen, you say. Of course she&rsquo;ll
have to make a show of goin&rsquo; to school for another
year on account of the law, but they can&rsquo;t ask it
before the fall term. I suppose she&rsquo;ll have to sleep on
this parlour lounge, though; there&rsquo;s no other place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>John O&rsquo;More was now beaming as he led Bird
through a couple of dark bedrooms toward the
kitchen, where the mysterious &ldquo;fire-escape&rdquo; seemed
to be located.</p>

<p>Going to an open back window he looked out,
motioning Bird to follow. What she saw was a
small platform, about three feet wide and ten feet
long, surrounded by an iron railing; one end was
heaped with a litter of boxes and broken flowerpots
that partly hid a trap door from which a ladder
led to the balcony belonging to the floor below. At
the other end, fastened in a baby&rsquo;s chair by the tray
in front, sat a dear little fellow with great blue eyes
and a curved, sensitive mouth, while tears were
making rivers of mud on his pale cheeks as he
sobbed softly to himself, &ldquo;I want to go; oh, I want
to get out and see the fishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you shall,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More, undoing the barrier
and lifting the child on his strong arm while he tried
awkwardly to wipe his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; said Bird, wetting her handkerchief
at the kitchen sink and gently bathing eyes, nose,
and mouth carefully, as Mrs. Lane had bathed
hers&mdash;only a day ago, was it? It seemed a lifetime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said Billy, gazing at Bird over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his father&rsquo;s shoulder, as he wound his little arms
around the thick neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your cousin Bird, come from the country to
play with Billy and take him to see the fishes. Go
out there on the platform with him a spell till the
heat dies down; the doctor says he&rsquo;s to get plenty of
air you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you get the air here?&rdquo; asked Bird,
wonderingly, looking at the paved yards filled with
rubbish, the tall clothes poles, and the backs of the
other buildings where more fire-escapes clung like
dusty cobwebs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air? Oh, out here and down in the street mostly
if there&rsquo;s no time fer going across to any o&rsquo; the
parks. Get a bit acquainted now, youngsters, for
I&rsquo;ve got to report at the stable before supper,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;More, putting Billy back into his chair and preparing
to leave, wiping the sweat from his face as if he
had thus put the whole matter of Bird from him.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the pair were silent. &ldquo;Is your
name Bird?&rdquo; asked Billy, eying her solemnly, and,
upon her nodding &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he rambled on, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a yellow bird in a cage downstairs at Mrs. Callahan&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
name is Canary and it can sing. Can
you sing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is, I used to last week,&rdquo; she said uncertainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the tears running between her fingers that she
held before her face, for in the past ten minutes her
last hope had fled. No room where she could work
alone, not even a back-yard garden or a leaf to pick,
and the bars of the fire-escape seemed to be closing
in like a cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re crying, too,&rdquo; said Billy, prying open
her hands with his thin fingers, while his lip quivered;
&ldquo;do you want to get out and see the fishes too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Billy, I do; but we can&rsquo;t go just now, so we
must play we are birds in a cage like the one downstairs,&rdquo;
smiling through her tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing for
you,&rdquo; and she began in a low voice a song that Terry
had taught her:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;When little birdie bye-bye goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent as mice in churches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He puts his head where no one knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on one leg he perches.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">When she finished, the little arms stole around her
neck also, and Billy, his face all smiles, said, &ldquo;That
bird&rsquo;s me, cause I&rsquo;ve only got one good leg, and I&rsquo;m
going to have you for my canary, only,&rdquo; looking at her
gown and hair, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re more black than yellow,&rdquo; and
giving her a feeble squeeze, &ldquo;and some day you&rsquo;ll get
me out to see the fishes, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>At his baby caress Love lit a new lamp in her dark
path and Hope stole back and led the way as she
hugged Billy close and said, &ldquo;Yes, some day we&rsquo;ll
surely get out of the cage together and fly far
away.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V">V</a><br />

MRS. LANE PLAYS DETECTIVE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several weeks after the reading of Aunt
Jimmy&rsquo;s will, it was the talk of the neighbourhood, the
alternate topic of conversation being the death of
Terence O&rsquo;More and the sudden disappearance of
Bird. For Bird&rsquo;s Uncle John had come and gone so
suddenly that few knew of his flying visit, and those
who did turned it into an interesting mystery. Some
said that he was a very rich relation from the west,
others that he was not an uncle at all, but the agent
of the State Orphan Asylum to which the Lanes,
afraid of being expected to care for Bird, had hurried
her off. It is needless to say that it was Mrs.
Slocum, piqued at not securing Bird as a maid of all
work and no pay, who concocted this tale.</p>

<p>In due time Probate Judge Ricker appointed
Joshua Lane administrator, to take charge of the
furniture and few effects that O&rsquo;More had left and
settle up his debts as far as possible. There was a
little money left of what his wife had inherited, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Northboro Bank, but only enough to pay his debts, it
was feared, without so much as leaving a single dollar
for Bird.</p>

<p>Since the homestead and Mill Farm property that
belonged to Mrs. O&rsquo;More had been forfeited through
some defect in the drawing up of a mortgage coupled
with O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s slackness in attending to the matter,
Joshua Lane had felt there was something wrong
and that a little good legal advice, combined with
common sense, might have at least saved something
if not the entire property.</p>

<p>When, a year later, the mill had slipped into
Abiram Slocum&rsquo;s hands, Joshua&rsquo;s suspicions were
again aroused, for Slocum&rsquo;s transactions in real
estate were usually adroit and to the cruel disadvantage
of some one, if not absolutely dishonest
according to the letter of the law; but when Joshua
had spoken to O&rsquo;More about the matter, he, feeling
hopeful about his painting, had put him off with a
promise to &ldquo;some day&rdquo; show him the &ldquo;letters and
papers&rdquo; that bore upon the unfortunate business.</p>

<p>The day had never come, and now that Joshua
had the right he determined to sift the affair thoroughly,
but the papers were nowhere to be found.
The envelope containing O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s bank-book held
nothing else but the certificate of his marriage with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Sarah Turner, and some letters from his mother
in the old country.</p>

<p>Joshua, though slow, was not without shrewdness,
and he had not only kept the old house where
the O&rsquo;Mores had lived securely locked by day,
until when, upon the selling of the furniture, it
should again return to the Slocums from whom it
was rented, but at Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s suggestion he had
Nellis, his oldest son, sleep there at night, as she
said, &ldquo;To keep folks whom I&rsquo;ll not name from
prowlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua looked to the sale of the furniture to at
least pay the last quarter&rsquo;s rent due. By a strange
happening the afternoon before the vendue was to
take place, as he was about to drive up to the old
house at the cross-roads to make a final thorough
search in closets, drawers, and the old-time chimney
nooks for the missing papers, a passer-by, hurrying
in the same direction, called out to him: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a fire up cemetery hill way; smoke&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; over
the hickory woods. Maybe Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s big hay
barn or Slocum&rsquo;s old farm, both bein&rsquo; in a plum
line from here.&rdquo; When, sharply whipping up the
old mare, much to her astonishment, he hurried to
the place, he not only found that it was the old
farm-house hopelessly ablaze from roof to cellar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but Abiram Slocum appearing a few moments later
by the road that ran north of the place, flew into
either a real or well-acted rage, shaking his fist
and calling: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that there hulking boy, Nellis,
o&rsquo; yourn, that has done me this mischief. Must
&rsquo;a&rsquo; smoked his pipe in bed or left his candle lighted
until it burned down, for it&rsquo;s plain to be seen by
the way the roof&rsquo;s ketched, the fire started upstairs
and smouldered around all day until it bust out
everywheres to onct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon yer insured,&rdquo; said Joshua, dryly,
taking little account of what he said, as he began
to realize that the fire had put an end forever to
the discovery of the papers that might have brought
good luck to Bird, as well as destroyed a part of
the slender property.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trifle&mdash;a mere trifle&mdash;not the cost of the
wood in the house, let alone the labour at present
rates. I could hev rented the place tew teachers
for a summer cottage for twenty a month, and I
intended buyin&rsquo; in the furniture so to do. If&rdquo;&mdash;and
he drew his mean features together, and
then spread them out again in a spasm of indignation&mdash;&ldquo;law
was just, you&rsquo;d ought to make it up to
me, Joshua Lane,&mdash;that you had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he found that the few neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
who had gathered were not sympathetic, and only
seemed to regret the fire on account of the O&rsquo;More
furniture, he disappeared, and, strangely enough,
later on no one could tell in which direction he
went or if he had gone afoot, on horseback, or in
the yellow buckboard in which he was wont to drive
about to harry his tenants and surprise his farm
hands if they but paused to straighten their backs.</p>

<p>When Joshua told of the fire at the supper-table,
Mrs. Lane fairly snorted with indignation,
saying, &ldquo;Firstly, Nellis didn&rsquo;t smoke last night,
bein&rsquo; out o&rsquo; tobacco and leavin&rsquo; his pipe on the
chimneypiece, where it is now, and secondly he
asked me for a candle; and then, the Lockwood
boys comin&rsquo; along, and offerin&rsquo; to walk up with
him, he went off while I was lookin&rsquo; for the store-closet
key which had fallen off its nail, and clean
through the bottom of the clock&rdquo;&mdash;(the inside of
the long body of the tall clock being the place
where the Lane family&rsquo;s keys lived, each on its
own nail).</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning when he came down home to
breakfast he mentioned it, and said it didn&rsquo;t
matter because the moon was so bright he undressed
by light of it, Bill Lockwood stopping up
there with him for company&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A trifle of insurance indeed! and all hope of
Bird bein&rsquo; righted gone! Joshua Lane, do you
know what I think and believe?&rdquo; And Lauretta
Ann jumped up so suddenly that her ample proportions
struck the tea-tray edge and an avalanche
of cups and saucers covered the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your thoughts and beliefs &rsquo;ll soon fill a book,
big as the dictionary and doubtless be worth as
much,&rdquo; said Joshua, pausing a second with a
potato speared on his fork, while he gave his wife
a stern, silencing look that was so rare that whenever
she saw it, she gave heed at once, &ldquo;but in
this here matter I&rsquo;d advise you to keep &rsquo;em good
and close to yourself. We&rsquo;ve got plenty ahead to
shoulder this summer, besides which if papers had
been found, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely any lawyer hereabouts
would risk taking the matter without money to
back him, and &rsquo;Biram Slocum to face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Joshua, having put himself outside of
the potato, a final piece of pie, and the tea that
had been cooling in his saucer, pushed back his
chair and drew on his coat, saying as he went out:
&ldquo;The first strawberries over ter Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ll be ready for marketing on Monday, and this is
Thursday. I must look around and engage pickers.
That acre bed of the new-fangled kind is a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ahead of Lockwood&rsquo;s earliest. Aunt Jimmy was
no fool when it came to foresighted fruit raisin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said she was, nor in other things
either if her meanin&rsquo; could be read. What time
did you say the fire started?&rdquo; she added in an
unconcerned sort of way, as she stooped to pick up
the scattered cups, which were so substantial that
they had not been broken by their fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;it must hev been close to two
o&rsquo;clock when I drove out of the yard; the mail
carrier had just passed, and he&rsquo;s due at the
corner at two, and at the rate I went I wasn&rsquo;t
fifteen minutes from the fire. From the way it
had holt, it must have been goin&rsquo; all of half an
hour. Queer &rsquo;Biram didn&rsquo;t scent it sooner workin&rsquo;
in the corn patch back of the wood lot as he
appeared to be, leastways he came down the lane
from there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire couldn&rsquo;t hev ketched before one o&rsquo;clock,
for the hands up at Lockwood&rsquo;s go up that way
before and after noon as well as of mornings, and
if Nellis had left anything smouldering, they&rsquo;d
have surely smelt it, first or last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua paused a moment, but, as Mrs. Lane asked
no more questions, went out, closing the door. No
sooner did she hear the latch catch than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
jumped up, saying to herself: &ldquo;Appeared to come
from the corn patch, did he? I wonder what he
was doin&rsquo; there? He planted late, so the corn
can&rsquo;t be set for hoeing; he <em>might</em> be watchin&rsquo; for
crows or riggin&rsquo; a scarecrow.&rdquo; As she pronounced
the last word she had reached the dresser
where hung a large square calendar that advertised
one of the husky sorts of breakfast foods
that taste as if they might have been the stuffing
of Noah&rsquo;s pillow.</p>

<p>Lifting this down she carried it to the table, and,
after hunting in the dresser drawer for the pencil
with which she kept her various egg and butter
accounts, she proceeded to put a series of dots
about the particular day of the month (it was
June 10th), and then reversing the sheet, she covered
the back with a collection of curiously spelled
and, to the casual observer, meaningless words.</p>

<p>She had barely time to replace the calendar when
the boys came in for their supper, and she fell
vigorously to rearranging the table and brewing
fresh tea.</p>

<p>The elder boys spoke of the fire as a bit of &ldquo;old
Slocum&rsquo;s usual luck,&rdquo; for it was known that the
house would need a great deal of repairing before
any one but the artist, whose thoughts were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the clouds, would be willing to hire it. Lammy
alone rejoiced in the fire because, as he said, &ldquo;When
Bird comes back, the house won&rsquo;t be there for her to
see and make her sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not say that outdoors,&rdquo; warned Nellis,
&ldquo;or Slocum &rsquo;ll say you fired it on purpose&mdash;he&rsquo;d
like nothing better. By the way, mother,&rdquo; he continued,
as Mrs. Lane glanced keenly at Lammy,
&ldquo;what do you think I heard at the shop to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Concernin&rsquo; what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Mill Farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think. Those Larkin folks hev worked
the land these two years past, but the mill hasn&rsquo;t
run this long while,&mdash;not since the winter Mis&rsquo;
O&rsquo;More died and the ice bulged the dam; the fodder
trade has all gone away, and I don&rsquo;t know what
&rsquo;Biram Slocum can turn it to &rsquo;nless he can insure
the water an&rsquo; then let it loose somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a party of engineer fellows, or something
of the sort, just come to camp out up by
Rooster Lake,&mdash;sort of a summer school, I guess, for
there are some older men along that they call professors.
They scatter all over the country surveyin&rsquo;
and crackin&rsquo; up the rocks with little hammers to see
what they are made of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon half a dozen of them came down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to the shop to see some new kind of a boring tool
that our foreman has designed, and Mr. Clarke was
with them,&mdash;you know he is the man who started
the Art and Trade School in Northboro, and has
his finger in a dozen pies. Pretty soon the superintendent
called me and said, &lsquo;Here, Lane, you live
out at Laurelville; these gentlemen wish to see the
old Turner Mill Farm place. I&rsquo;ll let you off the rest
of the day if you&rsquo;ll show them the way over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got in the runabout with Mr. Clarke and the
others followed in a livery six-seater. The old
gentleman asked me all sorts of questions about
the water-power, and how low the stream fell in
summer, and if the pond ever froze clear through,
and one thing and another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we got to the Mill Farm, there was no one
at home but the dogs and hens; I suppose the folks
had all gone to Northboro to the circus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough, it is circus day! How did I forget
it?&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Lane. &ldquo;That accounts for why
there were so few folks on the roads this noon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, everybody seems to have gone but ourselves,
even Lockwood&rsquo;s field-hands took a day
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did? Then they didn&rsquo;t go up and down
the cemetery hill road this noon?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, why should they?&rdquo; replied
Nellis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t remember that it was circus day, did
you, and I guess it is the first time you ever forgot
it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane to Lammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew&mdash;all right, but I&rsquo;m savin&rsquo; up for&mdash;you
know,&rdquo; replied Lammy, wriggling out of his chair
and going to the door where he began crumbing
bread and throwing it to some little chickens that
had strayed up out of bounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish you had mentioned it, anyhow; it
would hev done us all good to have a change,
though to be sure I <em>do</em> suppose some folks would
have turned our going into disrespect to Aunt
Jimmy,&mdash;Mis&rsquo; Slocum in particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went, and Ram, and Mr. Slocum, though
he came home early. I saw him down in the
turnpike store back of the schoolhouse this noon;
he was sayin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d had to come back early on
account of havin&rsquo; a lot of things to attend to over
at the Mill Farm this afternoon,&rdquo; said Lammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turnpike store? He doesn&rsquo;t trade there&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a mile out of his way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get to the Mill Farm, anyway,&rdquo; said
Nellis, &ldquo;because I was there from after dinner until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I came home just now. Where was I? You got
me all off the track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were sayin&rsquo; that Mr. Clarke asked you all
sorts of questions about the mill stream,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Lane, who now seemed to have lost interest in
Nellis&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&mdash;well, Mr. Clarke and that Mr. Brotherton,&mdash;that
is superintendent of the engine shop in
Northboro,&mdash;poked about a lot together, measuring
things and figuring in a little book he had in his
pocket. It looked as if they were going to make
an afternoon of it, and as I saw a fishin&rsquo; pole
inside one of the open sheds, I thought I&rsquo;d go
down the sluice way and try for a mess of perch.
I was lyin&rsquo; quiet out along a willow stump, thinkin&rsquo;
the folks were in the mill, when I heard voices on
the dam above. Mr. Clarke said: &lsquo;I tell you what,
Brotherton, I want you to negotiate this affair for
me. That Slocum is a tricky fellow. I saw him a
month ago and told him I&rsquo;d not touch the property
until that snarl about the mortgage foreclosure was
untangled, the price he asked was outrageous for
two hundred acres, of course the buildings are
only fit for kindling. Now I want you to either
buy me the farm and water right, or else lease it
for say twenty years; then I will run a spur of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Northboro Valley railroad down here, move the
locomotive works and the paper-mill, and enlarge
both plants. This is the right place; plenty of room
to build houses for the hands, and close enough to
my place to be under my eye without being annoying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It will suit my daughter Marion, too. She
has all sorts of ideas about building a model village.
Of course this is between ourselves, for if that old
Slocum rat dreamed that I was behind you, he
would ask a dollar a blade for every spear of run-out
wire-grass on the farm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of it!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Lane, sitting down
so suddenly in the big rocking-chair that it nearly
turned a somersault in surprise, &ldquo;and it was only a
scrap of a mortgage, not more&rsquo;n $2500, that was the
cause of workin&rsquo; the O&rsquo;Mores out of property that
had been in her family near two hundred years.
Everybody knows there was crooked business if
it could only be proved. But your father can&rsquo;t
find any papers, and now just as he was going this
afternoon to search through poor O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s furniture
and things at the house, it had to go and burn down,
and the hopes we had that something might be
worked out for Bird hev all gone up in smoke,&rdquo;
she said, addressing the stove solemnly.</p>

<p>The boys went out together to take a stroll up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to the scene of the fire. Hardly had they disappeared
when Mrs. Lane jumped from the chair
with such a bound that it completed the somersault
and stood on its head facing the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; she ejaculated, addressing the pump
by the sink, and shaking her finger at it as if the
gayly painted bit of iron was her husband. &ldquo;Yes,
it must be it. All along I allowed &rsquo;Biram Slocum
fired that house for the insurance. Now, by a new
light I read he did it so in case there was any papers
or letters to and fro about that mortgage that they&rsquo;d
get burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed he and she hev made plenty of
excuses to get into the house alone, but I never
reckoned it was for anything else but for general
meddlin&rsquo;, and pa&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; everything so close, even
nailing up the cellar doors and winders, balked &rsquo;em.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knew the auction was ter-morrow, and that he&rsquo;d
rather burn the papers and furniture than risk Joshua
or others finding &rsquo;em is my firm belief, and I&rsquo;d like
to prove it. Not that it&rsquo;ll do Bird any good now, but
it would be a satisfaction, even though, as Joshua
says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got enough business of our own to
shoulder before fall and settlin&rsquo; time comes.&rsquo; I wonder
if &rsquo;Biram &rsquo;ll hev the cheek to ask for the rent now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to do a little nosing on my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
account,&mdash;yes I be!&rdquo; she continued, adding more
mysterious words to the back of the calendar and
nodding determinedly at the pump as if it had contradicted.
&ldquo;Knowing never does come amiss, even if it
is salted down for a spell. Shoo!&rdquo; she cried presently,
waving the dish towel at the chickens who had
boldly ventured in, and then the tumult, caused by
Twinkle&rsquo;s chasing them back to their yard with much
barking and sundry nips, brought her back to the
present and the work of dish-washing and tidying the
kitchen for the evening.</p>

<p>Even then her head and hands did not work
together. She hung the biscuit in a pail down the
well and set away the butter in the bread-box, put
sugar instead of salt into the bread sponge she was
setting; and, finally, before she sat down to rest
remembering that the pantry door locked hard and
creaked when it opened, she poured toothache drops
instead of oil upon both hinges and key, and presently
began to sniff about and wonder if Dinah
Lucky, who had been in that day to do the weekly
laundry, was doctoring for &ldquo;break-bone pains&rdquo; again,
and hoped she had used the laudanum outside instead
of in, otherwise nobody could tell when she would
turn up to do the ironing.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning if Joshua Lane and Lammy had not
been in such a hurry to get down to the fruit farm to
prepare the crates and small boxes for the coming
strawberry picking, they would have noticed that
Lauretta Ann seemed to be quite excited and anxious
to get them out of the way.</p>

<p>But Joshua was unusually absorbed and quiet&mdash;he
was disappointed at not finding the papers&mdash;but he
had a hard summer&rsquo;s work ahead of him with plenty
of thinking in it; while as for Lammy,&mdash;he was trying
to calculate how many strawberries he must pick at a
cent and a half a quart to buy a round-trip ticket
from Laurelville to New York, so that he might invite
Bird to come up for a Fourth of July visit; also
as to whether it would be possible to do this and have
anything left to buy fire-crackers. Yet, after all,
crackers were of small account, for Bird did not care
much for noisy pleasure, and if she didn&rsquo;t come, he
wouldn&rsquo;t care for even cannon crackers himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose &rsquo;Biram Slocum will go over to Northboro
smart and early to collect his insurance,&rdquo; Mrs.
Lane remarked, apparently looking out of the window,
but stealing a side glance at her husband&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he will; but when I turned the cows out
an hour ago, I saw him driving Milltown way in his
ordinary clothes with a plough and a dinner-pail along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
so I reckoned he was goin&rsquo; to work on that patch of
early corn he&rsquo;s got down at the Mill Farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s eyes glistened, and she
plunged some dishes into the tub of suds with a
splash that was an unmistakable signal that breakfast
was over and all but lazy people should be out.</p>

<p>This morning she bustled so that a half hour did
all the work of &ldquo;redding&rdquo; up that usually took two
at the very least, and when Dinah Lucky came to do
the ironing with no sniff of laudanum about her,
though the kitchen was still heavy with it, Mrs. Lane
looked puzzled, then much to that fat aunty&rsquo;s astonishment
popped the batch of six plump loaves into
the oven and, leaving Dinah to tend the baking,&mdash;a
thing that save for illness she had never trusted to
other hands in her twenty years of housekeeping,&mdash;she
took a small basket, a knife, and her crisp gingham
sunbonnet, and muttering something about trying
to get one more mess of dandelion greens, even if
it was counted late, disappeared through the woodshed
door.</p>

<p>Dandelions grew in plenty in the moist meadow
below the cow barn, but Mrs. Lane crossed the road
and took a winding path through the woods. After
following this for some distance and crossing several
fields where she filled her basket with greens, cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
only the very youngest tufts with the greatest deliberation,
she turned into the highway through the
cemetery gate and walked rapidly past the &ldquo;four
corners,&rdquo; never stopping until she stood in the enclosure
that had once been Bird O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s garden.
Then she set down the basket, and, seating herself on
the scorched chopping-block, looked about her.</p>

<p>The house had burned down to the foundation;
some of the heavy chestnut beams had not been
wholly consumed but lay in a heap on the hard dirt
floor of the cellar. Otherwise the only bits of woodwork
remaining were the frames of two cellar windows
that had been protected by the deep stone niches in
which they rested. The great centre chimney, around
which so many old houses are built, held its own,
and its various openings, most of them long unused,
marked the location of the different rooms; several
of these, such as the smoke closet and brick oven,
being closed by rusty iron doors.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Lane set out on a tour of inspection.
The half dozen outbuildings were quickly explored,
for, with the exception of the barn, they were quite
open to the weather and as rickety as card houses.
Tall weeds struggled with the straggling sweet-william
and fiery, hardy poppies in the strip before the lilac
bushes that Bird had called her garden, and the rusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wire of the henyard fence enclosed a crowd of nettles
that stretched toward the light like ill-favoured prisoners
in a pen. The grass and low bushes had been
trampled by the people who had gathered to watch
the fire, as well as by the cows that had strayed in
through the latchless gate.</p>

<p>Clearly there was nothing to be discovered here.
Next Mrs. Lane walked about the ruined foundation
looking for a likely spot to get down into the cellar.
The old chimney with its nooks and crannies was the
only thing left to examine, and she had made up her
mind to do it even if it meant a rough climb, bruised
knees, and scratched fingers.</p>

<p>In some places little heaps of ashes were still
smouldering, but by picking her way carefully down
the stone steps that had been under the flap-door, she
reached the base of the chimney and tried the first
iron door. It was warped with the heat, but after
some difficulty she opened it, only to find the ample
closet absolutely empty. Talking to herself and
saying that it was not likely that anybody, even an
artist, would hide papers in a cellar, Mrs. Lane looked
up to see how it would be possible to reach what had
been the kitchen level, where the chances looked
brighter; for there was the brick oven and a wide fireplace,
closed by sheet iron through which a stove-pipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had pierced. There was no way up but to use the
chinks between the big stones for stairs and climb.
True, she had seen an old ladder in the barn, but
Lauretta Ann was too practical a woman to trust a
dozed rickety ladder&mdash;she preferred to cling with
her fingers and climb, and cling and climb she presently
did.</p>

<p>To young people it seems a very small feat to
climb the outside of a broad, rough, stone chimney
that slopes gradually from a wide base toward the
top. For Mrs. Lane&mdash;stout, thick of foot and nearer
fifty than forty&mdash;it was a terrible exertion, and she
paused between every step she took to catch her
breath, muttering, &ldquo;Lauretta Ann Lane, you are a
fool if ever there was one. Suppose folks should pass
by and see you creepin&rsquo; up here like a squawkin&rsquo;
pigeon woodpecker hanging to a tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She, however, did not in the least resemble even
that heavy-bodied bird. Did you ever see a woodchuck
mount a low tree when cornered by dogs?
That was what Mrs. Lane looked like as she
climbed. And did you ever see the same woodchuck
scramble, slip, and flop down, flatten himself,
and then amble to his hole, when he thought
his pursuers had ceased their hunt? Well, that was
the way in which Mrs. Lane came down to the cellar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
bottom, when she found that the brick oven had been
used merely to hold broken crockery and such litter.</p>

<p>For a minute or two she sat flat on the floor, resting,
nursing her bruised hands, and gazing idly at
the outline of the sky through one of the window
holes in the stone wall. Then, as she recovered
herself, a bit of something fluttering from a broken
staple in the scorched window-frame attracted her
attention. She picked herself up and examined it.
The glass had broken and fallen in, while the bit
of metal had caught a narrow rag of woollen material
some six inches in length. This was singed at
the edges, but enough remained to show that it was
a herring-bone pattern of brown and gray such as
is often seen in men&rsquo;s suitings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane looked at the rag thoughtfully for
a moment, then, detaching it, pinned it carefully
inside the lining of her waist, picked up her basket
of greens which were by this time rather withered,
freshened them with water from the well, and
trudged home openly by the highway, saying, as
she walked, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much, and most likely it&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo;&mdash;still maybe it&rsquo;s a stitch in the knittin&rsquo;, and
if it is, another &rsquo;ll turn up sooner or later to loop
on to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dinner Mr. Lane gave his wife an odd look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
saying: &ldquo;Why, mother, where&rsquo;ve you been? You
look as if you&rsquo;d gone a berryin&rsquo; on all fours!
You&rsquo;re scratched on the nose and chin, let alone
your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be I?&rdquo; answered &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; so fiercely that
Joshua quailed, and remembered guiltily that he had
forgotten her request to clear a tangle of cat brier
from over a tumble-down stone wall in the turkey
pasture, where his wife passed many times a day to
herd this most contrary and uncertain of the poultry
tribe, so he said nothing more, but held his quarter
of dried apple pie before his face like a fan, while he
slowly reduced its size by taking furtive bites at the
corners.</p>

<p>About four o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Lane seated herself on
the front porch to sew. She was dressed in a clean
print gown, with her collar fastened by a large
photograph &ldquo;miniature&rdquo; pin of Janey when a baby,
a sign that she considered herself dressed for callers.
True it was Saturday and Dinah Lucky was still
pounding the ironing board, but that was because
she had &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; on the two first week-days
sacred to such work, and not through any slackness
on Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>The weekly mending was always a knotty bit of
business, and to-day doubly so, for now that Lammy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>was working at the fruit farm, it seemed as if he
fairly moulted buttons and shed the knees and seats
of his trousers as crabs do their shells. Spreading
a well-worn pair of knickerbockers on the piazza
floor, she trimmed the edges of the holes and dived
into a big piece bag for material for the patches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I can&rsquo;t find two bits alike and I
do hate to speckle him up all colours and kinds as
if he was a grab-bag. I know what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
put in what I&rsquo;ve got and clip down to the store for
some blue jean, and run him up a couple o&rsquo; pairs
of long overalls to cover him, same as his brother&rsquo;s
and Joshua&rsquo;s. Wonder I didn&rsquo;t think of &rsquo;em before,
only I can&rsquo;t realize that Lammy is big enough to be
at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man&rsquo;s shadow crossed the piazza. Mrs. Lane
looked up quickly; she had not heard the gate
click, and Twinkle, who kept both eyes open as well
as ears cocked most of the time, was down at the
fruit farm with Lammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy something to-day? Nice goots, ver&rsquo; cheap,&rdquo;
said a voice in broken English, and a pedler stood
on the broad step and swung two heavy packs down
to the floor, while he wiped his face and asked if he
might get some water from the well.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill099"></a>
<img src="images/ill099.jpg" width="479" height="368" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Buy something to-day? Nice goots ver&rsquo; cheap.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, &rsquo;nless you&rsquo;d prefer milk,&rdquo; said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Lane, cheerfully, for she was naturally cheerful and
generous, unless she was imposed upon. The pedler,
a foreigner, had a full-moon face, that looked
both young and tired, two things that always
appealed to her, besides which his packs were
temptingly fat, and she had a weakness for pedlers.
So after getting the milk, she leaned back in her
rocker, folded her arms, and prepared to enjoy the
exhibition, saying in the same breath: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
as I care to buy. What have you got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The packs contained a little of everything in
addition to the usual tinsel jewellery and cheap finery
which she motioned aside, while she selected half
a dozen gingham shirts, the overalls, which the man
assured her truthfully were only what the goods
would cost in the village, and some stout red handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;d need trouble vit him,&rdquo; he said, pointing
to the tattered trousers. &ldquo;I sells you somedings
vot you can make down schmall,&rdquo; said the pedler,
growing confidential and pulling a stout pair of
long pants from a separate compartment in his pack.
&ldquo;Only a dollar, and I give the schentlemens ninety
cents for him,&mdash;yes, I did. I keep dem for mineself
if I home vas going, but I joust stard out.
Only von dollar, and only von leetle place broke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to trust to buy second-hand clothes;
nobody knows what kind of folks have wore &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
objected Mrs. Lane, yet at the same time fingering
the substantial goods lovingly. &ldquo;Where are they
tore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it vas, joust by der side leg ver you can
schmaller make him, and so help me gracious it vas
no dirdy peoples wore dem. It vas a rich mans to
sell so fine a pants for ninety cents for such a
break. Maybe you knows him alretty, for he live&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
eastward&mdash;&ldquo;in a big what you call red
house by the road there farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slocum&rsquo;s!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Lane, her hands
trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dat vas his name. You take de pants,
hein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Lane was silent, examining
the rent, for the trousers though bright and new
were of the same brown and gray herring-bone
pattern as the dingy rag she had brought from the
cellar window of the burned house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em. They <em>could</em> be cut to advantage,
and you may leave me a box of that machine
cotton, too; I&rsquo;m clean out. Now, pack up and move
on, my man; I&rsquo;ve got to see to supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She vas very glad of dose pants,&rdquo; thought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pedler to himself, as he trudged away, smiling at
the sales he had made.</p>

<p>Up in the attic Mrs. Lane presently stood by a
gigantic cedar chest, the lid of which she lifted
with difficulty, next the top tray. In the one below
she spread the pair of pants to the torn leg of which
was pinned <em>the</em> rag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem a shame to lay away a pair of
&rsquo;Biram Slocum&rsquo;s pants so near my weddin&rsquo; shawl,
but so must it be. Well, now, there&rsquo;s two stitches in
the garter I&rsquo;ve set up to knit for the hobbling of &rsquo;Bi
Slocum&rsquo;s pace; the third stitch will be to show why
he crawled in that cellar window before the fire for he
surely didn&rsquo;t do it after, and why he was afeared to
let his wife mend his torn pants.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a><br />

BIRD&rsquo;S COUSINS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the night of Bird&rsquo;s arrival in New York Jack and
Larry O&rsquo;More were late for supper. In fact they did
not come in until she had gone to bed on the &ldquo;extension&rdquo;
lounge in the parlour, where she was lying with
her teeth clenched in an effort to keep her eyes shut
and to choke down the nervousness to which crying
would have brought the quickest relief. If Bird could
only have been alone in the dark and quiet for a few
hours, it would have been much easier for her to have
overcome her great disappointment. But in the corner
of the family sitting room, amid a litter of sewing
and the smell of pipe smoke, with the glare and noise
of a busy street coming in the two small windows,
sleep was impossible. Finally her aunt closed the lid
of the sewing-machine with a bang, tossed her work
into a heap in the corner, and, turning out the gas,
went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>There were six rooms in the flat, all quite small.
The sitting room in front and the kitchen in the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had windows that opened out, above the three bedrooms
clustered round an air-shaft that was like a
great chimney having small windows let into it,
through which even at noon only a gray, sunless light
entered, and the air had no freshness but was full of
odours and noises from the flats above and below.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;More occupied the room next to
the sitting room, Billy sleeping beside them on a
small mattress that was propped up nightly upon two
chairs; for when the bed was thus made, there was no
room to move about. Jack and Larry slept in the
middle room which had a door into the hallway, while
the third room, opening out of the kitchen, had been
used by the oldest boy, Tom, before he had taken
wholly to wild ways and drifted off. Now it was
more than a year since he had slept there and it was
tightly packed with broken furniture, old boxes, and
various kinds of trash that it had been easier to throw
in there than to dispose of in any other way. A
small bath-room at the end of the hall was littered up
in much the same way, and it was evident that no one
cared for bathing, as the tub was used as a cubby
hole for pails, a mop, broom, and the wash boiler and
board, for which there was no room on the overloaded
fire-escape. Still Mrs. O&rsquo;More felt the dignity
of having a bath-room, for it stamped her home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
as a &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; tenements so called having no such
luxuries.</p>

<p>Presently Bird gave up all idea of going to sleep or
even of closing her eyes, and do her best she
could not keep from hearing the conversation that
passed between her aunt and uncle in the kitchen, for
they made no effort to lower their voices, and she dared
not close the door as the only breath of air that
reached little Billy, who was tossing about and muttering
in his sleep, came through the front windows.</p>

<p>After hearing herself thoroughly discussed until
her cheeks burned, her uncle closed with the remark,
&ldquo;Well, of course Terry was all kinds of a helpless
fool, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for it, his mother was
a lady out of our class, and his wife too, judging from
the looks and ways of the kid, and don&rsquo;t you forget it,
and it must come rough to her to be shoved about,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a new resolve came to Bird from the rough
but well-meaning words. Her grandmother and her
mother had been ladies,&mdash;she would not forget that
any more than she would forget her father&rsquo;s wish
that she should learn to paint and win the success that
had been denied to him.</p>

<p>Presently the subject changed and she heard her
aunt speak of Tom and say that it was three months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
since she had heard from him, and she feared he was
dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it will be three months more, then,&rdquo; O&rsquo;More
had cried with an oath that made Bird quiver and pull
the pillow over her head, but she was obliged to take
it off again because of the heat. &ldquo;He never minds
us unless he&rsquo;s in a scrape, or there&rsquo;s something to pay.
But he&rsquo;s not dead, if that&rsquo;s any comfort, for he wrote
to me two weeks gone, saying he must have fifty
dollars or leave his job, and I wrote him that he&rsquo;d
leave it for all of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never told me! I could have sent him
a trifle; God knows what he&rsquo;s done by this,&rdquo; and Mrs.
O&rsquo;More covered her red head with her apron and
began to whimper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rose O&rsquo;More,&rdquo; answered her husband,
while Bird judged by the jar that he had brought his
fist down on the table with a bang, &ldquo;that scoundrel
has bled you long enough; now we are saving up to
have little Billy doctored, and I&rsquo;ll not see you rob
yourself and him for that other that we gave the best
of everything, and he&rsquo;s turned it to the worst, even if
he is the eldest born. If I were you, I&rsquo;d bank the bit
o&rsquo; money that comes in from the sewin&rsquo; and not keep
it about ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The top drawer of the bureau is bank enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
me. The sum is near complete to buy the frame for
his leg, and it will be wanted next week when I take
Billy to the doctor, for it&rsquo;s to his own house he shall
go, and not to the thing they call the &ldquo;clink&rdquo; at the
hospital, to be stood up and twisted before a crowd o&rsquo;
dunce heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Billy was to go to a doctor. That was good
news, and Bird began to take an interest in life again,
for Billy, in a single hour had crept quickly into her
sensitive, motherly little heart, and with her to love
and to serve were one and the same impulse.</p>

<p>Presently two new voices joined the conversation,
knives and forks rattled, and amid pauses she heard
scraps of conversation muffled by food-filled mouths,
and knew that they were talking of her. Jack and
Larry had come home and were having supper. Jack,
who worked in an office by day, was attending
an evening school of type-writing and bookkeeping,
while Larry, who was of slight build and whose
ambition was to be a jockey and ride races, was kept
late on the track where he was serving an apprenticeship
as handy man to a well-known trainer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Let&rsquo;s have a peek at her. I hope
she&rsquo;s pretty if I&rsquo;ve got to look at her steady,&rdquo; said
Larry, who prided himself on his eye for beauty, and
wore plaid clothes and wonderful pink and green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
neckties, the colours of the stable to which he was
attached, and thought it the finest thing in the world,
for jockeys are often as loyal to their racing colours
as college men are to theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t so handsome but what it&rsquo;ll keep until
morning, and she&rsquo;s dead asleep by this. Quit yer
noise, all of ye; ye&rsquo;ll wake little Billy, and he&rsquo;s been
that fretful to-day that the rasp of his voice would
wear through an iron bar,&rdquo; Mrs. O&rsquo;More added, as
the three burst into loud laughter over some tale of
track happenings that Larry told.</p>

<p>Then the voices dropped to a hum, and then
turned to the song of the bees in Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s hives,
and Bird drifted away into that sleep that God sends
to make our tired bodies and minds able to live
together without quarrelling.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Bird slept heavily for many hours, yet to her it
seemed only a few minutes when she awoke again,
a streak of light shining directly across her face and
the same noises coming from every side. This time,
however, the light was from the sun, not from the
gas, and the noises were fourfold, for there is nothing
so varied, penetrating, and stunning as the sound
of the awakening of a great city to unaccustomed
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few moments she lay quite still, gazing about,
and trying to realize where she was, and whether
awake or asleep, for so many things had happened
during the past week, that it all seemed like a bad
dream.</p>

<p>Not many days before, morning light brought the
hope to Bird that this day her father might be better;
only the day before she had waked in Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s
big white bed, to see that kind soul watching beside
her and Twinkle had come racing upstairs.</p>

<p>Presently it all came back to her, and, getting up,
she raised the shade quietly, for no one else was
awake, and looked down into the street in which
wagons of all kinds were passing, while the sidewalks
were already, at six o&rsquo;clock, swarming with children,
driven into the air as early as possible by the heat of
the night. Then she looked about for her clothes
and a place where she might go to bathe and dress,
for the small rooms were all open through, and the
lack of privacy and the sight of the flushed disordered
sleepers was a fresh jar to her.</p>

<p>Finally she tiptoed into the kitchen where a
friendly clothes-horse offered shelter, and managed
to make herself neat, and arranged her hair at a
mirror hung over the kitchen sink, which she afterward
found was the family toilet place; then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
stepped out on to the fire-escape where there was
the possibility of a breeze.</p>

<p>At that moment she heard Billy&rsquo;s querulous little
voice wail, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so tired&mdash;tireder than last
night, and I hurt all over,&rdquo; and she slipped back
through the hallway into the front room again to
meet her aunt who stood in the middle of the parlour,
gazing at the empty sofa and open window in some
alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so yer up and dressed betimes and not fallen
out of the winder through sleep-walkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said,
not unkindly. &ldquo;Jack has turns of it at the coming
of every hot weather, and he&rsquo;s been down the escape
to the ground, up to the roof and every place he
could get, so it gave me a turn when I missed yer.
Here, I&rsquo;ll just throw a few clothes on Billy and you
can take him down to the street for a mouthful of air,
while I get the breakfast. I&rsquo;ll fetch him to the
doctor to-day if it does put back my sewin&rsquo;, and
see if I can&rsquo;t get some ease for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I wash him first?&rdquo; Bird asked quickly, as
his mother began to pull and jerk at his clothes, and
then stopped short as she saw a flash in her aunt&rsquo;s
eyes that told her that she must be careful what
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wash him this time of the morning when he&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
scarce awake, and have him all tired before he has a
bite of breakfast? I guess not. You can clean him
up this noon, before I take him to the doctor&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
and Billy, now hopping, now stumbling along on his
little crutch, led the way down the three flights of
dark stairs, moving carefully from step to step so
that he should not trip in the holes in the carpet
with which they were covered.</p>

<p>Once in the street Bird was at the same time
interested and confused by what was going on about
her. A Jewish fish pedler, with much wagging
of head and hands, was trying to sell some stale-smelling
flat-fish to a woman who had preceded
them downstairs. Another pedler, with a push
cart, piled high with cabbages, radishes, and greens,
went into one of the houses with a basketful of his
wares at the very moment that a big, roan truck-horse
halted with his soft, inquisitive nose dangerously near
the green stuff. First he sampled a bunch of radishes,
but these were too hot for his taste, so he tried a
carrot or two, and mangled fully a peck of spinach
before he sniffed the cabbages. At these he gave a
whinny of delight and nosed among them so vigorously
that half a dozen rolled into the gutter, and
when the man returned, the horse had started back a
yard or so in fright and looked guiltless of the mischief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and the pedler ran down the street after some
suspicious-looking boys. Meanwhile the horse
stepped forward and nibbled the biggest cabbage
with great relish, while Billy clapped his hands, half
a dozen other children cheered, and Bird herself
laughed and felt glad to see the horse, who did
not look overfat, have such a good breakfast.</p>

<p>For if Bird loved flowers and all outdoors, she
loved animals still more even if she did not know it,
but the other children did not think of the horse at
all; they were only glad because it had outwitted
the pedler, for between the people of poorer New
York and the push-cart people there is everlasting
war. This lesson Bird learned that morning before
the various factories in the neighbourhood had blown
their seven-o&rsquo;clock whistles.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck her sensitive ear was
the different languages that were spoken by the
passers-by,&mdash;the various mixtures of slang and foreign
idioms that the speakers used for English being
almost as difficult for her to understand as the German
and Italian.</p>

<p>At Laurelville, to be sure, people spoke in two
ways. The real country folk had a vigorous, if
homely, dialect, such as the Lanes spoke, while Dr.
Jedd, the minister, and her father and mother used a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
purer speech, though her father alone had the soft,
distinct way of pronouncing the words that was one
of Bird&rsquo;s great attractions.</p>

<p>Little Billy, however, was quite at home with this
street language, as far as understanding it went, but
no word of it came from his baby lips, strangely
enough, and though he was really over six years old,
he had the slight frame and innocent, open-eyed gaze
of a child of four, and he was entirely &ldquo;different
like&rdquo; from the rest of his family, as his mother said,
and it provoked her as if the fact of the child&rsquo;s
being apart from her own rudeness was a personal
reproach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Billy,&rdquo; called a freckled, lanky-looking
girl of perhaps fifteen,&mdash;reading by her face, though
she was no taller than Bird,&mdash;who was coming across
the street from a grocer&rsquo;s carefully carrying a bottle
of milk as if it was a rare possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mattie,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully, hopping
to the curb to meet her. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been? I
thinked you moved away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working all of two weeks, and we
moved right in back of your house yesterday.
We&rsquo;ve got two fine rooms now, and I buy Tessie
a bottle of milk every morning now my own self,&rdquo;
she said proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tessie&rsquo;s legs are very bad again, and I can&rsquo;t get
her out except Sundays when mother&rsquo;s at home to
help, but she&rsquo;s got a rocking-chair and she can pull
it all round the room an&rsquo; see up out the winder to
your &rsquo;scape. We seen you sittin&rsquo; up there last night.
Who&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo; she added, dropping her voice as
Bird drew near to Billy, not knowing how he went
about alone and fearful lest he should fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bird, my cousin; she came last night from the
far-away country,&rdquo; he answered, clinging to Bird&rsquo;s
hand, while the two girls looked at each other,
one shyly and the other&mdash;city bred and quick-witted&mdash;curiously,
noticing at once the plain black
gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to visit or stop?&rdquo; she asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to stay,&rdquo; said Bird, slowly, only half
realizing the truth of the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any brothers and sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s tough luck,&rdquo; said Mattie, her tone
full of sympathy. As she set the precious bottle on
a damp spot on the sidewalk, so that her hands need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
not heat the milk, she noticed the tears in Bird&rsquo;s
eyes and changed the subject quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to work soon? I&rsquo;ve got a good
job&mdash;cash-girl&mdash;$3.50 a week, Saturday afternoons
off all summer; &rsquo;n, if I&rsquo;m smart in a year, I can get to
be an assistant stock-girl. How old are you, anyhow?
I&rsquo;m fifteen and over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirteen and Uncle John is going to send
me to school by and by; he says that it closes
too soon to make it worth while this term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll have to go until you&rsquo;re fourteen or
they&rsquo;ll chase you up, even if you do live in a flat
with stair carpet. It&rsquo;s too bad, though; you&rsquo;d have
lots more fun working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to go to school as long as I can,&rdquo;
said Bird, smiling at Mattie&rsquo;s mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you want to begin in an office type-writing
or keeping sales books. I don&rsquo;t like that;
it&rsquo;s too slow and you can&rsquo;t see the crowd. You&rsquo;ll
have a daisy time this summer, though, with nothin&rsquo;
to do but takin&rsquo; Billy riding in trolleys and seein&rsquo; the
town. I&rsquo;ll tell you all the parks where they have
music. Billy&rsquo;s pa is free with dimes for trolley rides.
Last year, before my pa&rsquo;s falling accident, we lived
down this street, and when Tessie&rsquo;s legs were well
enough, Mr. O&rsquo;More &rsquo;d often give me a quarter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
take Billy along fer a ride. You can ride near all
day fer that, if you know how to work the transfers
and stick up fer yer rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your father badly hurt?&rdquo; asked Bird, drawn
to this stranger by a common chord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, hurt dead,&rdquo; she answered, in a matter-of-fact
tone without the trace of a tremble, &ldquo;and then
pretty soon we had to move, and we&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo;
it most ever since, so I kinder lost track o&rsquo; Billy.
You see mother worried sick and we all got down on
our luck, but now she&rsquo;s got a steady job to do scrubbin&rsquo;
at the Police Court, and I&rsquo;ve got a job, and
we&rsquo;ve got two rooms and everything is all hunky;
that is &rsquo;cept Tessie&rsquo;s legs, but some&rsquo;s worse than her
and can&rsquo;t even sit up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you live behind us; which house is it?
Perhaps I could see your sister through the window,&rdquo;
said Bird, somehow feeling reproached at Mattie&rsquo;s
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little low house down in the yard, back
of yours, that&rsquo;s got winders that stick out of the roof.
Ours is the top middle and it&rsquo;s got blinds to it,&mdash;all
the winders haven&rsquo;t,&mdash;and they&rsquo;re fine to draw-to if
it rains, &rsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t have to shut the window.
It&rsquo;s a rear building, and some don&rsquo;t like &rsquo;em, and of
course Tessie would rather see out to the street, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rents come so high and rear buildings are stiller at
night; that is, when there&rsquo;s not too many cats.
Were rents high a month where you came from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; said Bird, trying to remember.
&ldquo;I think we paid ten dollars, but we had
a whole house, though it was old, and a garden, and
a woodshed, and a barn, and chickens. Everybody
lived in whole houses in Laurelville, even though
some had only two or three rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars for all that, and we pay eight for two
rooms!&rdquo; ejaculated Mattie, looking hard at Bird to
see if she was in earnest, and, seeing that she was,
quickly grew confidential, and, coming close, whispered:
&ldquo;Would you, may be, sometime come in and
tell Tessie about it and the garden and chickens?
She&rsquo;s read about the country in a book she&rsquo;s got,&mdash;oh,
yes, she can read; she&rsquo;s twelve and went to school
up to last year, for all she isn&rsquo;t much bigger &rsquo;n Billy&mdash;but
she can&rsquo;t seem to understand what it&rsquo;s just
like and she&rsquo;s cracked after flowers; the man in the
corner market gave her one in a pot last year, but
it didn&rsquo;t live long because we hadn&rsquo;t a real window
that opened out then. Maybe your aunt won&rsquo;t let
you come &rsquo;cause we live in a rear; my mother says
she&rsquo;s awful proud; but then, most anybody would be,
living in a whole flat with bells and a stair carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Bird,&rdquo; she continued, after a moment&rsquo;s
silence,&mdash;during which the pedler had given up
chasing the boys, rearranged his scattered wares, and
plodded patiently on,&mdash;this time dropping her voice
to a whisper and putting her lips to the other&rsquo;s ear,
&ldquo;if yer aunt won&rsquo;t let yer come over, maybe you&rsquo;d
wave to Tessie when you and Billy&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; the air
on the &rsquo;scape. I&rsquo;ll tie a rag to our blind so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll
know the winder. It would be an awful lot of company
fer her daytimes when we&rsquo;re out to have somebody
to wave to. Yer will? I believe ye; somehow
I could tell in a minute ye&rsquo;d be different from the
rest,&rdquo; and giving Bird a thump on the back expressive
of gratitude, Mattie picked up her milk bottle
and hurried round the corner.</p>

<p>A shout from above next attracted Bird, and looking
up she saw her uncle leaning out of the window
and calling to them to come up for breakfast. Billy
could hop downstairs quite easily, but in going up
he was obliged to crawl, baby fashion, on his hands
and knees, so Bird followed, slowly carrying his crutch.</p>

<p>Her uncle and cousins were already seated at the
table when the pair came up, both rather out of
breath. Of the two boys, Larry made no attempt to
rise and shake hands, but stared hard at Bird&rsquo;s pale,
clear-cut face and neatly brushed almost blue-black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hair and lashes that made her violet-black eyes
darker yet, then gave a quick nod in which recognition
and approval were combined, and continued his
meal; while Jack got up, came forward pleasantly, if
with the very flourishy sort of manner that somehow
always reminds one of the pigeon wings and squirrels
in old fashioned writing-books, and waved her to a
seat between himself and his father and began to collect
the dishes about her plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with yer eatin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;More, rather
sharply, as if resenting the attention. &ldquo;Bird can
wait on herself,&mdash;she&rsquo;s got all day to do it in and
it&rsquo;s time you were off. Come round this side by
Billy&rsquo;s chair so&rsquo;s you can spread his bread; he&rsquo;s
always cuttin&rsquo; himself,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The food was plentiful enough, if rather coarse in
quality,&mdash;a dish of oatmeal, slices of head-cheese
and corn-beef on the same dish, potatoes sliced cold
with pickled cabbage, a bowl of hard-boiled eggs,
a huge plate of bread with a big pot of coffee, still
further heating the close room from its perch on the
gas range. But the table-cloth was soiled and tumbled,
and Bird saw with horror that her uncle wiped
his mouth on the edge of it, using it as a napkin,
while the dishes seemed to have been thrown on
without any sort of arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Not feeling hungry herself, she began to cut up
some meat for Billy, who fed himself awkwardly
using his knife instead of a fork; but Bird did not
dare say anything, and in a few minutes his appetite
failed and he sat picking holes in a piece of bread,
while Bird looked at the heaped-up plate her uncle
pushed toward her with dismay, yet forced herself to
eat from inbred politeness.</p>

<p>Larry and Jack, having finished, pushed back their
chairs, and hastily filling their lunch-boxes with bread,
meat, and eggs, took their coats from the rack in the
narrow hall and went out, Larry calling, &ldquo;So long,&rdquo;
as he went downstairs, but Jack turned back and
said pleasantly to Bird, &ldquo;Good-by till night, and don&rsquo;t
get homesick, Ladybird!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladybird, indeed,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. O&rsquo;More, &ldquo;you
needn&rsquo;t bother; she can&rsquo;t well sicken long over what
she ain&rsquo;t got,&rdquo; at which unnecessarily cruel remark,
that made Bird stoop lower over her plate and
swallow some coffee so quickly that coughing hid her
tears, O&rsquo;More looked up and said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong
with yer to-day, Rosy? You&rsquo;ve no call to hit out
when nobody&rsquo;s touchin&rsquo; yer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? What&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;d like you to
tell me?&rdquo; she flashed; &ldquo;me with a lot uv sewin&rsquo; to
do, and to get Billy up-town to the doctor&rsquo;s by ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t do that tomfool dressmakin&rsquo; with my
leave and consent. I can keep my family and well,
too, if you weren&rsquo;t so set on robbin&rsquo; yerself fer Tom,
who&rsquo;ll land himself in prison yet for all of you, if,
please God, he doesn&rsquo;t drag the rest of us along with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can wash the dishes and dress Billy if I may,&rdquo;
said Bird, timidly, feeling the tension of a bitter
quarrel in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you may try it for onct, but look to it you
neither smash them nor make him cry; there&rsquo;s
days he near takes fits at the sight of water. Here&rsquo;s
his clean suit, and I&rsquo;ll just go and finish up that silk
skirt,&rdquo; and Mrs. O&rsquo;More pulled some clothes from a
corner bureau and left Bird and Billy alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry with what she says,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;More, in a gruff whisper, pressing Bird&rsquo;s shoulder
with his kindly grasp. &ldquo;Just you be good to the
little feller and yer Uncle John &rsquo;ll stand by yer, and
maybe ye&rsquo;ll see some way to chirk things up a bit.
I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; some of puttin&rsquo; a bit uv an awning
out on the &rsquo;scape to keep the sun off him while he&rsquo;s
takin&rsquo; the air, only travellin&rsquo; so much I&rsquo;ve not got to
it. I&rsquo;d do it to-day, only I must go to the yards to
unload a car o&rsquo; horses. To-morrer, maybe, I&rsquo;ll stay
around home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want any breakfast, Billy?&rdquo; Bird
asked, as her uncle clumped downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;yes,&mdash;I&rsquo;m hungry, but I&rsquo;m tired more,&rdquo; he
answered, laying his head on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I wash and dress you first, and then you
can go out on the piazza and eat something and see
if you can spy Tessie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you hurt Billy&rsquo;s bones when you wash him?
Ma always does,&rdquo; he added, his lower lip beginning to
quiver. He always called himself by name and often
spoke in short sentences as very young children do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to; and if I do, you must tell me and
I&rsquo;ll stop right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird looked about the room to see what she could
find without calling her aunt, whose very presence
seemed to irritate Billy. There were two stationary
wash-tubs beside the range; one of these being
empty, she proceeded to fill it half full of water,
making it comfortably warm by aid of the tea-kettle.
Next she hunted up a piece of soap and found a
towel with much difficulty, for the roller towel on
the kitchen door was for general use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and play duck and go in swimming,&rdquo; she
said to Billy, who had been watching her with interest
as she overturned a pail and put it in the corner of
the tub for a seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea struck the child&rsquo;s fancy so completely
that he could hardly wait to slip out of his few
clothes and be helped up on a chair and then into
the tub, where he sat comfortably pouring the water
over himself with a tea-cup, and chuckling in a way
that would have warmed his father&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bird gathered the dishes together in
the sink, wiping off the plates with bits of bread,&mdash;as
she had done ever since she could remember and
had seen her mother do in the short &ldquo;better days&rdquo;
when they had a pretty home and her mother had
always herself washed the best china in the inside
pantry,&mdash;and straightened the furniture and hung up
various articles that littered the floor so that there
was room to move about. By this time Billy was
ready for drying, which Bird did so gently that he
did not even wince, for she had ministered to her
father, seen her father care for her mother, and God
had given her the best gift that a girl, be she child or
woman, can have,&mdash;the gift of loving touch, of doing
the right thing almost unconsciously for the weak or
helpless.</p>

<p>Billy, clean, refreshed, with his bright hair brushed
into a wreath around his forehead, sitting in his little
chair on the fire-escape, and being fed with bread
and milk by Bird, who talked to him as he ate, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
a different being from the crumpled little figure that
had only a few moments before looked so pathetic
sitting in his high-chair, head on table.</p>

<p>As Bird gave him the last morsel and wiped his
mouth, he leaned backward to where she knelt behind
him and, clasping his arms around her neck,
pulled her head down to him, and, nestling there,
whispered, &ldquo;Billy loves Bird very much, and she
must stay close by him forever &rsquo;n&rsquo; ever, won&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, that must be Tessie&rsquo;s window down there,&rdquo;
she said, not trusting herself to answer and catching
sight of a white rag hanging from the blind of a low
building that stood in the rear of a shop that fronted
on the next street. It was an old-fashioned, two-story,
wooden house, with dormer windows in a roof that
had been once shingled. There were a dozen such
in Laurelville, and as Bird looked at it she wondered
how it came to be there, built in on all sides, and if
it didn&rsquo;t miss the garden that must have once surrounded
it.</p>

<p>Then as she looked she saw the outline of a face
inside the window. It was so far down and across
that she could not distinguish the features, but she
waved the towel she held, and Billy shook his hand.
Presently something white waved back, and thus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
telegraph of love and sympathy crossed the dreary
waste of brick and clothes-lines, and put the three in
touch, and the Bird, who had been taken from the
country wilds and put in a city cage, and the two
little cripples were no longer alone, for even at these
back windows there was some one to wave to and
respond.</p>

<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;More was in a better mood when, an hour
later, having finished the gown, she came back to the
kitchen to find the dishes washed and set away, and
Billy sitting contentedly in his chair throwing crumbs
to try to coax some pigeons that lived in the stable
next door from the roof to the fire-escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him up to the doctor&rsquo;s now,&rdquo; she said to
Bird, without vouchsafing any remarks upon the improved
appearance of the kitchen, though she saw
it all. &ldquo;You can come along with me if you like,
or you can stop here and look about and rest yourself
a bit. There&rsquo;s plenty of passing to be seen from
the front room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird said she thought she would rather stay at
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind, now, and lock the inside hall door as soon
as we&rsquo;ve gone and don&rsquo;t let anybody in, for, in spite
of the catch on the door below, there&rsquo;s always pedlers
and one thing and another pushing up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>After Mrs. O&rsquo;More had left, Bird went through
into the sitting room. Seating herself by the window
with her arms on the sill, she looked down into the
street. It was an intensely hot day in spite of a
breeze that blew from the East River; down by the
pavement the mercury was climbing up into the nineties&mdash;summer
had come with a jump. Could it be
only a week ago that she had been picking long-stemmed,
purple violets by the brook beyond the
wood lot at Laurelville? Was it only day before yesterday
that Lammy had brought her the red peonies,
and they had walked up the hill road together?</p>

<p>She had stayed by the window for some time, perhaps
half an hour, watching the horses that were led
out from the stable to be cooled by spray from the
hose attached to the hydrant in front, when a slight
noise in the kitchen caused her to turn. The light
from the window opening on the fire-escape was
darkened, and a man&rsquo;s figure showed for a second in
outline against the sky and then swung noiselessly
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Bird&rsquo;s first impulse was to scream, but, checking it,
she shrank trembling behind a tall rocking-chair and
watched. The man glanced about the kitchen and
came directly through to the room where her uncle
and aunt slept. It did not seem to occur to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
there was anybody at home, though Bird did not
think of this until afterward.</p>

<p>Pausing before the bureau, he opened the upper
drawer, and, after passing his hand rapidly through
the clothing it contained, drew out a long wallet,
which Bird recognized as the one from which her
aunt had taken some money before going to the doctor&rsquo;s.
Without thinking of the result or counting the
cost, she rushed forward and caught the wallet tight
in both hands, crying, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take it, you
shan&rsquo;t; for it&rsquo;s the money to pay for mending poor
Billy&rsquo;s leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man, taken utterly by surprise, fell back, but
only for a moment, and, muttering a string of such
words as Bird had never before heard, seized her by
the shoulder with one hand while he tried to wrench
the pocket-book from her with the other; but, strong
as he was, this took several minutes, for Bird hung on
desperately, clinging to his arm after he had secured
the wallet, until finally he picked her up bodily and
threw her on to the bed, and before she could recover
herself, locked the door into the sitting room, and,
taking out the key, did the same to the door into the
boys&rsquo; room, through which he retreated, leaving her
a prisoner, for the window into the air-shaft was high
out of reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>As Bird sat on the edge of the bed sobbing with
fright and the thought of what the loss of the money
might mean to Billy, noise of a scuffle reached her
ears from the kitchen and the locked door burst open
suddenly as it had closed, pushed by a strong shoulder,
but it was the face of a perspiring policeman
that peered through the crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him, oh, do catch him!&rdquo; she implored; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
got the money from Aunt Rose&rsquo;s drawer that&rsquo;s to pay
for mending Billy&rsquo;s leg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s caught safe enough, my girl,&mdash;me mate has
him in the kitchen and the money, too, though he did
try to throw it over the yards when we grappled him.
You see there&rsquo;s been a slew of these daylight thieves
around these parts lately, sneaking over roofs and
down escapes when folks are at work. We spotted
this one goin&rsquo; through the saloon on the corner and
in among the skylights, and we followed but lost
track, for he has another wallet lifted besides this
one, and if he&rsquo;d slid out a minute sooner, we&rsquo;d have
lost him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then holding on did some good, after all,&rdquo; Bird
gasped, still standing with tightly clasped hands as if
she were holding the precious money in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; did yer grab him, now? Look at that fer
pluck,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t smash yer entirely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Come out and take a look at him; maybe ye can tell
did ye see him before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird looked, but the young man was a stranger to
her. He did not appear to be more than twenty, and,
as they led him away, handcuffed to an officer, he
pulled his hat so low over his face that the crowd
that gathered and followed as soon as the street was
reached could not see his features, or if he was old
or young.</p>

<p>Bird gave the officer her uncle&rsquo;s name, and he said:
&ldquo;When he comes in, tell him to come round to the
station-house and he&rsquo;ll get his money all right. I&rsquo;ve
got to take it in as evidence.&rdquo; The street was hardly
clear again of the curious crowd when the twelve-o&rsquo;clock
whistle sounded and workmen appeared from
all quarters, either with pails to eat their dinners in
the shade of the house fronts, or on the way to their
various homes.</p>

<p>Mrs. O&rsquo;More and her husband&mdash;for he had been
watching for their car&mdash;came up the street together,
little Billy between them, and it was strange that they
did not meet the policemen with their prisoner. Bird
was watching eagerly for them, and, after hearing
their news,&mdash;that the doctor said it was possible to
help the lame leg, only that Billy must grow stronger
before it could be done,&mdash;told them hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Both listened eagerly. Her uncle said, &ldquo;Yer pluck
does credit to the O&rsquo;Mores, but did ye mind the
villain&rsquo;s face what it was like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Bird answered excitedly, &ldquo;it was
smooth and fair, and he had very blue eyes with a
long scar over one, and his hair was quite red.&rdquo;
Glancing at her aunt, she saw that she had turned
deadly pale, and a certain resemblance struck her for
the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help us,&mdash;it&rsquo;s Tom come back to rob his
own mother,&rdquo; gasped poor John O&rsquo;More.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not appear against him, John,&rdquo; cried
his wife, throwing her arms around him as he seized
his hat and turned to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, woman, I can&rsquo;t; but maybe it&rsquo;ll do no
good. I must go round to the station and get
the wallet and see to this, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bird, after laying Billy on the lounge for a
nap, sat by her aunt,&mdash;who, while waiting to hear
the outcome, had collapsed and was crying noisily,&mdash;and
tried to take off her tight waist and bathe her
face, and she realized that there were even worse
griefs than leaving one&rsquo;s home and father, for surely
dear Terry was safe beyond all harm now.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br />

SUMMER IN NEW YORK</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrest of Tom O&rsquo;More threw the matter of
little Billy&rsquo;s leg into the background for a time.
When the father had gone to the court where his son
was arraigned, he found that not only was there another
charge against him, but that all unknown to his
family he had committed petty thefts in other places,
and had already what the police call &ldquo;a record,&rdquo; so
that he had to go to the penitentiary for a year, and
John O&rsquo;More, feeling his disgrace keenly, for though
he was a rough man and coarse in many ways he
was as honest as the day, turned doubly to little Billy,
and could not bear to have him out of his sight when
he was at home.</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s orders concerning Billy had been
short and clear, but it was fully a week after the
visit before his mother could pull herself together or
even think of carrying them out, and then when
O&rsquo;More took a day at home and had leisure to ask
for details, she began by saying that what the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had ordered to get the child in condition for treatment
was nonsense, and only to be had by rich folks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, woman, let&rsquo;s hear and get to the core
o&rsquo; the matter,&rdquo; said John O&rsquo;More, tired of the continual
word warfare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to have a real bed and no shake-down, so&rsquo;s
he can stretch out and roll about, and it&rsquo;s to be in a
room opening to the light where he can lie quieter by
himself an hour or so every day. Then he&rsquo;s to get a
full bath every morning and a light meal, and fresh
meat at noon, and a bite and sup between that at supper,
and the between times filled in with air and a
bottle o&rsquo; tonic, and the saints knows what else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do yer think I keep a &rsquo;ospital to do all them
things,&rsquo; sez I to the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answers quick like, &lsquo;and for that reason
I think it will pay you best to send him to the &rsquo;ospital
to get him built up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His father will not hear to it,&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you know what <em>I</em>
think; go home and talk it over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So John O&rsquo;More sat and thought and blinked at
the ground, and thought some more, but it was Bird
who first spoke, though very hesitatingly, for her
aunt resented almost everything she said, and in her
ignorance and prejudice seemed to owe poor Bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a grudge as being partially responsible for Tom&rsquo;s
arrest, rather than showing any gratitude toward her
for trying to prevent the theft of the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t Billy have a bed in the little room that
was&mdash;that is shut up?&rdquo; she asked finally. &ldquo;The
door is close to the kitchen window, and a good deal
of air would come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s packed solid full, and besides the room is
off from me, so&rsquo;s I couldn&rsquo;t hear the child to tend
him in the night if needs,&rdquo; objected Mrs. O&rsquo;More,
somewhat hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t the things be put in the attic or somewhere?&rdquo;
persisted Bird, seeing a flash of approval
cross her uncle&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;and then there would be
room for two beds, and I could stay with Billy and
give him his bath every morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attic! do you hear her?&rdquo; mocked the aunt,
&ldquo;and a fine slop there&rsquo;d be in me kitchen, and a nice
place for folks to eat breakfast, with the bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the things were taken out of the bath-tub we
could use that,&rdquo; continued Bird, waxing bold at the
prospects, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure, Aunt Rose, it would be
much nicer for you to have the parlour to yourself,
and not have to make me a bed there every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That last is true; I&rsquo;ve been greatly put out these
days when company called,&rdquo; the company being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
slipshod factory girls for whom she did sewing, but,
as often happened, Bird had unconsciously said the
one thing that could have appeased her aunt, for only
when something was suggested that would benefit
herself was she willing to have others considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tub is full of holes, and the agent he won&rsquo;t
mend it, saying that I made them with the ice-pick,
when for convenience I used that same tub for an
ice-box, me own givin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all, a bit o&rsquo; solder is cheap,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More,
springing to his feet, and preparing to take action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve the day on me hands, and a few extry dollars
in me pocket, and if something can&rsquo;t be worked out
o&rsquo; this, &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be my fault; and while I recommember
it, I think you&rsquo;d be the better of a new hat, Rosie,
and while yer out buyin&rsquo; it, jest step in the store,
round on Third Avenue and get two o&rsquo; them light-lookin&rsquo;,
white iron beds; they&rsquo;re cheap, for I saw
yesterday when passin&rsquo; that they be havin&rsquo; a bargain
sale of them,&rdquo; and John, with the quick-witted diplomacy
of his race, handed his wife some money which
she took, and, half mollified, at once prepared to go
out, instructing Bird to &ldquo;do up the rooms&rdquo; while she
was gone.</p>

<p>The door had not fairly closed when O&rsquo;More gave
a shout that almost frightened Bird, and said: &ldquo;Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
we&rsquo;ll do some hustlin&rsquo;; there&rsquo;s no attic, me girl, but
there&rsquo;s the coal-closet in the cellar which is empty,
now that we use gas in the range. Half the stuff is
but fit for the ashman, and the rest I&rsquo;ll bundle down
there quick as I get a man from the stable to help.
Now watch sharp whilst I put the truck out and
see if there&rsquo;s aught yer can use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the room was finally cleared, a mirror, a
chair, and a small chest of drawers were the only useful
assets, and these Bird pulled into the kitchen,
while she dusted and wiped away at them until they
looked clean, even if somewhat shabby.</p>

<p>Returning from the cellar O&rsquo;More (in his youth a
handy man in a stable) attacked the dust in the little
room with broom, mop, and finally a scrubbing-brush
to such good purpose that in an hour it was quite
another place, for the walls fortunately had been
painted a light cream and were in fairly good condition.</p>

<p>If John O&rsquo;More had been asked to go down on his
knees and scrub a room, he would have resented the
work as an insult to his manhood, but love had set the
task. Little Billy, sitting there in his chair, his face
all eagerness, needed the room, and so he did the
work as nonchalantly as he would have stepped into
the stable and curried a horse in a hurry time. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was only when Bird clapped her hands in admiration
and said, &ldquo;Why, uncle, how nice and quick you did
that; Dinah Lucky would have taken a whole day,&rdquo;
that he became embarrassed, and, giving her an
apologetic wink, said with lowered voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a job
well done, but whist! &rsquo;tis not for the good of my
health to be repeated,&rdquo; and Bird understood and
wondered, as she did a hundred times during that
long summer, why she always understood her uncle
and he her, while life with her aunt seemed one
long misunderstanding.</p>

<p>A plumber, living in the flat below, came up in the
noon hour and soldered the holes in the tub, which
O&rsquo;More declared to be too black even for a pig&rsquo;s
trough, so he sped out around one of those many
&ldquo;corners,&rdquo; of which at first Bird thought the city
must be made, for a quart of boat paint and a brush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer aunt must be havin&rsquo; a hard time with her
tradin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he remarked on his return, seeing that his
wife had not come back to prepare dinner. But
just as Bird had spread the table with various articles
of cold food, whose abiding-places she very
well knew, and was making Billy some little sandwiches
to coax him to eat meat for which he had a
distaste, Mrs. O&rsquo;More came in, talkative and almost
pleasant as the result of her morning&rsquo;s bargaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Before night two narrow beds were carefully fitted
into opposite sides of the little room, with the chest of
drawers set between, in front of the now-closed door
that led to the boys&rsquo; room, with the looking-glass hung
above it. It was only a bit of a place and still very
close and stuffy, but Billy and Bird had at least beds
of their very own, if only in a niche apart, and Bird&rsquo;s
heart took fresh courage.</p>

<p>The next step was to coax her uncle to fill some
long boxes with earth and set them inside the outer
railing of the fire-escape. There is a law against
filling up these little balconies with boxes or furniture
of any kind, but Bird knew nothing about it,
and her uncle regarded it as a sort of tyranny that
he, a free-born citizen, should disregard. All Bird
thought of was that she might plant morning-glory
seeds in the earth so they would climb up the strings
she fastened to the next story, and later on there was,
in truth, a little bower blooming above that arid waste
of bricks and ashes.</p>

<img src="images/ill137.jpg" width="377" height="541" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><i>Bird and Billy on the Fire-escape.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>After the new room was arranged, and permission
given to Bird to see that Billy had what the doctor
ordered that he should eat, and to take him out whenever
he wanted to go, everything began to move more
regularly and in some respects more comfortably, then
Bird, to her dismay, saw the city summer, like a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
roadway without a tree or bit of shade, stretching
out before her.</p>

<p>There was not a book in the house and no one to
tell her of the free library where she might get
them, and school, where she hoped to find a sympathetic
teacher for a friend, belonged to September
three months away. No one who has always lived
in the city can possibly understand what this change,
with its confinement and lack of refined surroundings,
meant to this young soul. To be poor, in the
sense of having little to spend and plain food, she
was accustomed,&mdash;in fact, she had much more to
eat now, and through her uncle&rsquo;s careless kindness
she was seldom without dimes for the trolley rides
to Battery Park &ldquo;where the fishes lived,&rdquo; or Central
Park with the swan-boats that were to &ldquo;make a
man&rdquo; of Billy. But to be shut away from the woods,
the sky, the beauty of the sunsets, to have no flowers
to gather and love, and to be brought face to face
daily with all the ugliness of the life that is merely
of the body, was almost too much for her courage.</p>

<p>How could she keep her head above the street
level, how remember what her father had taught
her?&mdash;already the memory of the past was becoming
confused. Sometimes she was on the verge of
ceasing to try and settling down into a silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
drudge, content to take what came, and falling into
the habits and commonplace pleasures of the girls
of her cousins&rsquo; acquaintance with whom she was
thrown in the parks and on the stoop and streets.
It would have been much easier in some respects,&mdash;her
aunt would have been better pleased to see her
go off with the others, to some noisy if harmless
excursion, arrayed in a cheap, flower-wreathed hat
and gay waist, shrieking with laughter, and chewing
gum, than to see her always neat amid disorderly
surroundings and ever willing to do the endless
little tasks that her own mismanagement piled up,
and Ladybird&mdash;Jack&rsquo;s name for her&mdash;strangely
enough seemed a term of reproach, not compliment.</p>

<p>At first Bird had hoped that Sunday might bring
better things; but no, Sunday in the quiet, peaceful,
Protestant sense that Bird understood it,&mdash;there was
none. The family straggled to early mass one by
one, for Mrs. O&rsquo;More and her sons were Romanists,
though O&rsquo;More was not, being from the north of
Ireland, and the rest of the day was spent by the
men either lying in bed and smoking, or standing
in groups about the street.</p>

<p>In these hard days little Billy was Bird&rsquo;s only ray
of light. The two, being of equally sensitive natures,
clung together, and the child was so happy in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
new-found friend and ceased his incessant fretting
whenever he was with her, that Mrs. O&rsquo;More at last
gave him completely to Bird&rsquo;s charge with a sigh of
relief, for her youngest child was as much a puzzle
to her as her niece, and she felt that he also was of
a different breed, as it were, and it annoyed her.</p>

<p>All the fierce scorching summer days Bird and Billy
wandered about together, sometimes going over to
Madison Square, sometimes riding in the trolley to
Central Park, but more often down to the Battery
where the air tasted salt and good, where the wonderful
fishes lived in the round house and the big ships
went past out to that unknown sea of which Bird was
so fond of telling Billy stories.</p>

<p>Bird, too, soon learned to find her way about, for
six-year-old Billy had all the New York gamin&rsquo;s
knowledge of his whereabouts coupled with a
cripple&rsquo;s acute senses. He hopped along with his
crutch quite well, and many a lesson in human
nature and life did Bird learn these days in the treeless
streets of poorer New York.</p>

<p>After a time she found that her uncle had seemed
to forget his hatred of anything like drawing or
painting, so one day she ventured to buy a good-sized
pad and pencil, and then watching Bird &ldquo;make
pictures&rdquo; became Billy&rsquo;s great joy, while she to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
surprise found that she could draw other things
besides flowers.</p>

<p>Oftentimes the children would go down to sit on
the steps and watch the horses from the great sales
stable being exercised up and down the street. Bird
tried to draw these too, and one day succeeded so
well that her uncle, passing in at the door, stopped
and looked down, and then said, &ldquo;Bully! any one
would know it for a horse, sure!&rdquo; After that she
worked at every odd minute.</p>

<p>She loved horses dearly, but she and Billy were
forbidden to go into the stables, which were almost
underneath the flat, and Bird really had no wish to,
for the men there were so rough and there was so
much noise and confusion; but a few doors away
was a fire-engine house where lived three great,
gentle, gray horses that ran abreast, and had soft
noses that quivered responsively when they saw
their driver even in the distance. Bird made friends
with these, taking them bits of bread or green stuff,
until the firemen came to expect the daily visit and
&ldquo;Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; became familiar names in the
engine-house; and there was a little dog there that
ran with the engine and reminded her of Twinkle.</p>

<p>Dan was the heaviest of the three horses and
Bird&rsquo;s favourite, and one day, after many attempts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
seated on the stoop of the next house, she succeeded
in drawing a small head of him that was
really a good likeness, at least so the firemen
thought, for they put it in a frame and hung it in
the engine-house, and the next day big Dave Murray,
Dan&rsquo;s driver, gave her a small box of paints
&ldquo;with the boys&rsquo; compliments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, if the big, bluff fellow only knew what the
gift meant to poor little Ladybird struggling not
to forget and to still keep the heavenly vision in
sight.</p>

<p>Bird had written a short note to Mrs. Lane telling
of her safe arrival in the city, and giving her address,
but more than that she could not say. If she said
that she was happy and gilded the account of her
surroundings, it would have been false. If she told
the truth, her Laurelville friends would be distressed,
and it would seem like begging them to take her back
when it evidently was not convenient, for she did
not know that her Uncle John had refused to let
her stay with Mrs. Lane unless she was legally
adopted.</p>

<p>Neither was Bird worldly wise enough to act a
part and simply write of her visits to the park and
the little excursions with Billy which in themselves
were pleasant enough. She was crystal clear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
knew of but two ways, either to speak the whole
truth or keep silent. She was too loyal to those
whose bread she was eating to do the first, and so
she did not write.</p>

<p>In due time a long letter came from Lammy
written with great pains and all the copy-book
flourishes he could master, telling of Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
strange will, of how he was going to work all summer
at the fruit farm, and ended up by telling her
of the preparations he had made for the Fourth,
never dreaming it possible that, the matter of
tickets disposed of, Bird should refuse his invitation.</p>

<p>At first the thought of getting away from the
city, and being among friends again quite overcame
her. She began to wonder if Twinkle would be
glad to see her, and if the ferns met over the brook
as they did last year, and if Mrs. Lane would have
the white quilt on the best-room bed, or the blue-and-white
patch with the rosebuds. Then she
realized that if she met the Laurelville people face
to face, she would surely break down, while the
saying &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; again would be harder than
not going. Then, too, there was little Billy. How
could she leave him at the very time when, in spite
of continued hot weather, he seemed to be gaining?</p>

<p>No&mdash;she sat down resolutely and wrote a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
note that wrung her heart and kissed it passionately
before she mailed it, for was it not going to the
place that now seemed like heaven to her?</p>

<p>But the letter that arrived as the Lanes sat on
porch after supper said no word of all this, and
seemed but a stiff, offish little note to warm-hearted
Mrs. Lane and Lammy who, having now quite
earned the ticket money, was cut to the quick when
he found that it was all in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to the city and forgotten us,&rdquo; he
gulped in a quavering voice, as he read the letter,
coming as near to letting a tear run down his nose
as a sturdy New England boy of fourteen could
without losing his self-respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doos <em>appear</em> that way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lane, who
was gazing straight before her out of the window
with an abstracted air; &ldquo;but, after all, what&rsquo;s in appearances,
Lammy Lane? Don&rsquo;t your copy-book
say that they are deceitful? Well, that&rsquo;s what I
think of &rsquo;em. Likely &rsquo;nough it appears to Bird
that I didn&rsquo;t want to keep her, &rsquo;cause owing to this
other mix-up, I couldn&rsquo;t divide the share of you
boys without thinking it over, and &rsquo;dopt her then
and there. But my intentions and them appearances
is teetotally different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Lammy, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; straight on lovin&rsquo; Bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and trustin&rsquo; her and keepin&rsquo; a place in my heart
for her, besides havin&rsquo; the best-room bed always
aired and ready, and jest you keep on lovin&rsquo; and
trustin&rsquo; her, too, and like as not the Lord will let
her know it somehow, for I do believe kind feelings
is as well able to travel without wires to slide
on as this here telegram lightnin&rsquo; that hollers to
the ships that&rsquo;s passin&rsquo; by in the dark. &lsquo;Think
well and most things &rsquo;ll come well,&rsquo; say I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s will? Yer always
thought well enough o&rsquo; her,&rdquo; said Joshua, who had
laid down his paper and folded his spectacles to
listen to the reading of the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I do still,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane averred stoutly; &ldquo;it
doos <em>appear</em> disappointing, but I allers allowed that
if we was only able to read her meanin&rsquo;, &rsquo;twould
be a fair and kindly one.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br />

THE FLOWER MISSIONARY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the last day of June when one morning,
before the sun had a chance to turn the pavements
into ovens, Bird, having finished some marketing
for her aunt, was leading Billy slowly in and out
along the shady sides of the streets toward Madison
Square, where they were watching the lotus plants
in the fountain for the first sign of an open flower,
for already buds were pushing their stately way
through the great masses of leaves.</p>

<p>Chancing to glance at the window of a newly
finished store that was not yet rented, Bird read
the words, &ldquo;Flower Mission.&rdquo; As she paused to
look at the sign, wondering what it might mean,
an express wagon stopped at the curb and several
slat boxes and baskets filled with flowers, for sprays
peeped from the openings, were carried into the
building, a wave of moist coolness and perfume
following them.</p>

<p>Bird&rsquo;s heart gave a bound of longing, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
fragrance of the flowers painted a picture of her
little straggling garden and held it before her
eyes for a brief moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look, Bird, come quick and look; it&rsquo;s all full
of pretty flowers in there! Do you think they would
let Billy go in and smell close?&rdquo; Billy was standing
by the open door, and, as Bird glanced over his
shoulder, she saw that one side of the store was filled
by a long counter, improvised by placing boards
upon packing cases, which was already heaped with
flowers of every description in addition to those that
the expressman had just brought.</p>

<p>An elderly lady, with a big, white apron tied over a
cool, gray, summer gown, was sorting the flowers
from the mass, while a tall, slender young girl, of not
more than sixteen, dressed all in white, was making
them into small bouquets and laying them in neat
rows in an empty hamper.</p>

<p>It was the young girl who overheard Billy&rsquo;s question
to Bird and answered it, saying, &ldquo;Of course
Billy may come in and smell the flowers as much as
he pleases, and have as many as he can carry home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, can we?&rdquo; said Bird, clasping her hands involuntarily
with her old gesture that expressed more
joy than she could speak.</p>

<p>At the sound of the second voice, the young girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pushed back the brim of her drooping, rose-trimmed
hat and looked up with clear, gray eyes. As she did
so Bird recognized her as Marion Clarke, the daughter
of the man who spent his summers in the stone
house on the hillside beyond Northboro, and it was
she who had passed Bird and Lammy on the roadside
the day when she had left her old home and,
carrying Twinkle, was going to Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>But if Bird recognized Marion, the memory was on
one side, as it is apt to be where one sees but few
faces and the other many. This however did not prevent
Marion from holding out her free hand to the
younger girl, as she made room for her to pass
between the boxes, saying, in a charming voice, low-keyed
and softly modulated, yet without a touch of
affectation: &ldquo;If you are fond of flowers and can
spare the time, perhaps you would help us this morning;
so many of our friends have left the city that we
are short-handed. Here is a little box your brother
can sit on if he is tired.&rdquo; Oh, that welcome touch of
companionship, and that voice,&mdash;it made Bird almost
choke, as she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy is my cousin, and I should love to tie the
flowers, for Aunt Rose does not expect us back until
noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was one of Marion Clarke&rsquo;s strong points, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
as she was, that she had insight as well as tact. She
saw at a glance that these children were not of the
ordinary class that play about the streets, interested
in every passing novelty, merely because it is new,
so she had given Bird a friendly greeting and
asked her to help, instead of merely offering the
children a bouquet and letting them pass on as
objects of charity, no matter how light the gift.</p>

<p>When Bird replied in direct and courteous speech,
Marion knew that she had read aright. An ordinary
street child of that region would have said, &ldquo;I dunno
&rsquo;s I will,&rdquo; or &ldquo;What &rsquo;ll ye give me &rsquo;f I do?&rdquo; or perhaps
declined wholly to answer and bolted off after
grabbing a handful of flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Laura, will you let us have some string?
There, see, it is cut in lengths, so that you can twist
it around twice and tie it so. I do wish people
would tie up their flowers before they send them,
they would keep so much better; but as they do not,
we have to manage as best we may.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how nicely you do it,&rdquo; she continued, as Bird
held up her first effort for approval,&mdash;a dainty bouquet
of mignonette, a white rose, and some pink
sweet-william, with a curved spray of honeysuckle to
break the stiffness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So many people put the wrong colours together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and tie the flowers so tight that it seems as if it
must choke the dear things,&mdash;see, like this,&rdquo; and
Marion held up a bunch in which scarlet poppies and
crimson roses were packed closely together without a
leaf of green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand; those colours&mdash;hurt,&rdquo; Bird
answered, groping for a word and finding exactly the
right one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have lived in the country and been a
great deal with flowers to touch them so deftly and
know so well about the colours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always lived in the country until this summer,
and Terry taught me all about the colours and how to
mix them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was Terry?&rdquo; asked Marion, much interested,
and not knowing that she was treading upon
dangerous ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was father,&rdquo; and Bird, remembering where
she was, stopped abruptly, and Marion, who had
noticed the rusty black gown, understood that there
was a story in its shabby folds and forbore to intrude.</p>

<p>Miss Laura Clarke, who was the lady in gray, gave
Billy a pasteboard box lid of short-stemmed blossoms
to play with, and he sat quite content, while the
others kept on tying the flowers until only one
basketful was left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The flowers come in every Wednesday morning,
and I ask people to send them in as early as possible,
so that they may be sorted and tied up by ten
o&rsquo;clock when the ladies come to distribute them,&rdquo;
Marion explained as they worked. &ldquo;They are Miss
Vorse, the deaconess from the mission, beside two
workers from the College Settlement, and half a
dozen district visitors. Those two hampers go direct
to hospitals, but the ladies take the flowers about to
the sick in the tenements and to special cases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come here from the country place where I
live every week all through May and June, but this is
my last day this season, because I&rsquo;m going to Europe
next week with my aunt, and Miss Vorse will take
my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another disappointment for Bird. At last she
had met some one to whom she had felt drawn, and
whom she thought she might see occasionally, and
almost in the same breath learned that she was
going away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any children who would like
some flowers, or any one who is ill?&rdquo; she added, as
she noticed that Bird was silent and loath to go,
even though all the bouquets were ready and Miss
Laura was packing them in the baskets and boxes
for distribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Tessie; oh, I know that Tessie would
love to have some!&rdquo; cried Bird, eagerly; &ldquo;she has
not waved to us for nearly a week, and I was going
to see her this afternoon when Billy takes his nap,
if Aunt Rose will let me,&rdquo; and Bird told what she
knew of the little cripple who &ldquo;kept house&rdquo; by herself
while her mother and sister worked.</p>

<p>Then a happy idea came to Marion Clarke.
Handing out a flat wicker basket, that held perhaps
twenty-five bouquets, to Bird, she said: &ldquo;Would you
like to be one of the Flower Missionaries this
summer and carry bouquets? Yes?&rdquo; as she saw
the glad look in her eyes; &ldquo;then you may fill this
basket, and here is a big bouquet for you and something
extra sweet to add to the basket,&mdash;see, a bunch
of real wallflowers, such as grow over seas, some
foreign-born body will go wild with joy over it, and
here is a fruit bouquet a youngster has evidently
put together,&mdash;big strawberries on their stalks set
in their own leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Vorse is coming now. I will introduce you
and tell her to give you the flowers. What is your
name? Bird O&rsquo;More. I&rsquo;m glad of that; it seems to
fit you. I should have been disappointed if it had
been Jane Jones,&rdquo; she continued, as a sweet-faced,
tall young woman, dressed in a dark blue gown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bonnet, entered, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I am late,
but there is so much illness among the little children
in the district now that I could not get away.
A new Flower Missionary! That is good; children
can reach those whom we cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently Bird found herself walking along the
street, Billy&rsquo;s hand in one of hers, and the basket of
flowers in the other. Billy was prattling happily, but
for once she scarcely heard what he said, the flower
voices were whispering so gently and saying such
beautiful things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take us to Tessie,&rdquo; whispered one. &ldquo;God lets
us bring sunlight to dark places,&rdquo; said another&mdash;&ldquo;You
can do the same.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be happy, you have
something to give away,&rdquo; breathed another, and
this flower was a spray of cheerful honeysuckle
that blooms freely for every one alike.</p>

<p>Yes, Bird was happy, for Marion Clarke had held
her by the hand and called her a Flower Missionary;
she had flowers to give away and flowers to take
home. Oh, joy! she could try to paint them, and
she pushed the bouquet that held the old garden
flowers, the mignonette, sweet brier and honeysuckle
under the others to keep for her own.</p>

<p>If she waited to go home first, the flowers might
fade, so an impulse seized her to give Tessie her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
flowers first, and then turned into the street below
their own, trying to remember Mattie&rsquo;s directions&mdash;&ldquo;Count
six houses from the butcher&rsquo;s, and then go
through the arch, and up two pairs of stairs to the
top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she had gone a block, two little girls had
begged her for flowers, one rosy and sturdy chose
red and yellow zenias; the other, who, like Billy, had
a &ldquo;bad leg&rdquo; and hopped, chose delicate-hued sweet
peas. Bird had never seen a lame child in Laurelville,
but now she met them daily, for such little
cripples are one of the frequent sights of poorer New
York.</p>

<p>At the first corner a blind woman, selling the
mats she herself crocheted, begged for &ldquo;a posy that
she could tell by the smell was passing.&rdquo; To her
Bird gave the bunch of mignonette. A burly truckman,
who thought she was selling the flowers, threw
her a dime and asked for a &ldquo;good-smellin&rsquo; bokay for
the missis who was done up with the heat,&rdquo; so she
tossed him back the coin and a bouquet of spicy
garden pinks and roses together, while Billy called in
his piping voice, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a Flower Mission&mdash;we gives
&rsquo;em away,&rdquo; so that the man drove off laughing, his
fat face buried in the flowers.</p>

<p>When Bird had counted the &ldquo;six houses from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
butcher&rsquo;s&rdquo; and found the archway, which was really
the entrance to a dismal alley, her basket was almost
empty. She hesitated about taking Billy into such a
place, and in fact but for her great desire to give
Tessie the flowers, she would have turned back herself.
As she looked up and down the street, a policeman
passing noticed her hesitation and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s the plucky girl from Johnny O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s
beyond that tried to catch the thief,&mdash;and what do
you be wantin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird recognized the policeman and explained, and
he said, &ldquo;Ye do right not to be pokin&rsquo; in back buildings
heedless; it&rsquo;s not fit fer girls like you, but this
same is a dacent place, though poor, and as I&rsquo;m not
on me beat, only passin&rsquo; by chance, I&rsquo;ll go through
to the buildin&rsquo; with ye, and the kid can stay
below with me while ye go up, for stairs isn&rsquo;t the
easiest fer the loikes av him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So through they went, the big policeman leading
the way, and entering the back building Bird began
to grope upward. When the house had stood by itself
in the middle of an old garden, the sun had shone
through and through it, but now the windows on two
sides were closed, and the halls were dark, and the
bannister rails half gone.</p>

<p>At the first floor landing she paused a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
What was that tap, tapping? It came from a small
room made by boarding off one end of the broad,
old-fashioned hallway. The door was open and a
single ray of sun shot across from an oval window
that had originally lighted the stairs and was high in
the wall.</p>

<p>In the streak of sun was a cobbler&rsquo;s bench and on
it sat a man busily at work fastening a sole to a shoe,
so old that it scarcely seemed worth the mending.</p>

<p>Then she went on again and, after knocking at two
wrong doors, finally found the right one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; piped a shrill, cheery voice; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
come to open it,&rdquo; and in Bird went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped that you would come to-day,&rdquo; said the
small figure, sitting bolstered up in a wooden rocking-chair
with her feet on a box covered with an end of
rag carpet, by way of greeting. No introduction was
necessary, for the two girls knew each other perfectly
well, although their previous acquaintance had merely
been by waving rags across the yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My legs haven&rsquo;t felt as if they had bones in &rsquo;em
in a week,&rdquo; Tessie continued, &ldquo;so&rsquo;s I couldn&rsquo;t reach
up high enough to wave, and it seemed real lonesome,
but I&rsquo;ve got a new pattern for lace, and there&rsquo;s
a man in the store where Mattie works who says he&rsquo;ll
give me half-a-dollar for every yard I make of it,&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
do you think of that?&rdquo; and she spread out
proudly a handsome bit of Irish crocheted lace upon
which she was working. It was four inches wide, a
combination of clover leaves, and very elaborate, of
the kind that is so much sought now and costs many
dollars a yard in the shops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; explained Bird; &ldquo;how do you
know how to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother learned long ago in the Convent in
the old country, but her hands are too stiff to make it
now, and besides she says it wouldn&rsquo;t pay her. So
she showed me the stitch and some of the old patterns,
and one night last week, when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep
very good, I was thinkin&rsquo; of the lace work, and I
guess I must have dreamed the new pattern, for the
next morning I worked it right out. Those leaves
is like some that came in a pocketful of grass Mattie
fetched me home; one day they were cutting it over in
the square, and the man let her take it. I just love
the smell o&rsquo; grass, don&rsquo;t you? And now&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t get
out, Mattie brings me some in her pocket every time
she can. I guess she will to-night if they&rsquo;ve cut it
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time Bird held her basket behind her, but
now she wheeled about and rested it on the arm of
Tessie&rsquo;s chair. The joy of the child was wonderful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
almost startling. Her dark eyes dilated and she
looked first at Bird and then at the flowers, as she
almost whispered in the excitement of her surprise,
&ldquo;Ye ain&rsquo;t got &rsquo;em to keep, have ye?&rdquo; Then as Bird
tipped them into her lap, &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t fer me, fer
sure?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill158"></a>
<img src="images/ill158.jpg" width="376" height="480" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>They ain&rsquo;t fer me, fer sure?</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are, and I&rsquo;m going to bring you some
every Wednesday,&rdquo; said Bird, joyfully, and then she
told about Marion Clarke and the Flower Mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it jest heavenly to think of,&mdash;me with a
whole winder to myself that opens out and the crochet
to do and real flowers, new ones that ain&rsquo;t been
used at all,&rdquo; and Tessie leaned back and closed her
eyes in perfect content.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Bird&rsquo;s sorrow seemed to grow
lighter and life a little brighter, and the sunlight as
it were crept in to sweeten them both&mdash;she had
something to give away, and lo, it was good.</p>

<p>Tessie was down handling the blossoms again and
discovered the berry bouquet beneath. &ldquo;Oh, but
here&rsquo;s growing strawberries on a bush like! Well, I
never, never! But they&rsquo;re handsome! Maybe I
could make a pattern from them, too. Oh, surely
there&rsquo;s angels about somewhere doin&rsquo; things. You
know Father John, he says I&rsquo;ve got a Guardian Angel
looking out after me, and St. Theresa my name saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>chose her, and that everybody has, though for a long
spell I didn&rsquo;t know it. You see it&rsquo;s been easier for
her to look after me since we&rsquo;ve got a room with an
opened-out winder. I reckon if I was an angel, I
wouldn&rsquo;t care to poke around air-shafts much. Oh,
what&rsquo;s these browny-yeller flowers that smell so
elegant?&rdquo; and Tessie held up the wallflowers.</p>

<p>When Bird told their name, Tessie gave a little cry
and said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re what mother talks about that
grew up in the wall below the big house at home
where her father was a keeper, and the smell of them
came in the cottage windows in the night air right to
her, and she&rsquo;s often said she&rsquo;d cross the sea again to
smell them if she had the price, and now she won&rsquo;t
have to take that trouble. That angel has found
our winder for sure. Would you get me the little
pitcher and some water in it yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The larger of the two rooms, the one with the
window, had two clean beds in it, over which a newspaper
picture of the Madonna and Child was pinned
to the wall, two chairs, and an old bureau, while the
smaller room, little more than a closet, held a table,
a few dishes, and an oil cooking-stove, all as neat
as wax. A pail of water stood on the table, from
which Bird filled the pitcher, and set it on a chair by
Tessie that she might herself arrange the flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Then, remembering that the policeman and Billy
were waiting, she picked up her basket and her own
flowers, and, promising to come the next week, groped
her way downstairs again.</p>

<p>Bird did not see the tired mother, when she returned
from her day&rsquo;s scrubbing, enter the dark room and
drawing a quick breath say, in an awe-struck voice, &ldquo;I
smell them&mdash;I smell the wallflowers! Sure, am I
dreaming or dying?&rdquo; or see the way in which she
buried her face in the mass, laughing and crying
together, when the lamp was lit and Tessie had told
her the how and why of it.</p>

<p>There were dreary days often after this, when her
uncle was away on long trips and her aunt was cross,
but though Bird did not yet give up all hope of going
back some day among her friends, or studying, as
she had promised her father, she was learning the
lesson of patience, which, after all, is the first and
last one to know by heart.</p>

<p>Now the morning-glories had reached the window
tops, and in the little bower above the
clothes-lines she and Billy often sat as she told
him stories of the real country, of Lammy and
Twinkle, the old white horse, and the red peonies,
and flew there in imagination. Then the child&rsquo;s
big eyes would flash as he gazed at her, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
always ended by asking, &ldquo;When we stop being birds
in this cage, we&rsquo;ll fly right up there to your country
and be real birds and see Lammy and Twinkle,
won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; And Bird always answered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; to
please him, but it was a word that meant nothing to
her. So the summer wore on, and Bird did not go
back to Laurelville.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br />

&rsquo;RAM SLOCUM&rsquo;S TAUNT</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Bird was putting away from her all
thought of going back to Laurelville for a summer
visit, Lammy Lane was trying in every way to bring
about her return.</p>

<p>His mother was the only person in the family or
village who really read Lammy aright and valued
him at his worth. She never laughed at his
various contrivances and mechanical inventions, and
when he appeared to be star-gazing, she firmly
believed that it was not idleness, but that he was
interested in things other than the mere jog-trot
work on the farm.</p>

<p>His brothers had all taken up other occupations
in factory and shop, and Joshua Lane had expected
that easy-going Lammy, the youngest by several
years, would naturally drift along into farm work;
but the boy had said, when his father had spoken
upon the subject, &ldquo;Farming is all right, only this one
isn&rsquo;t big enough for mo&rsquo;n two, and I like to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in the country for pleasure; but for a trade I&rsquo;m
going into making somethin&rsquo; that bugs can&rsquo;t eat,
and that won&rsquo;t get dried up, nor drowned out
neither.&rdquo; To Joshua this remark savoured of feeble-mindedness;
but when he repeated it to Dr. Jedd,
that keen-eyed person laughed, saying they need
not worry about Lammy, for that some day he
might surprise them all.</p>

<p>All through June he worked diligently at strawberry
picking; then currants and raspberries followed
in quick succession, so that it was nearly
August, when, with twenty dollars to his credit in
the Northboro Savings Bank, he took a vacation
and went to his old haunts with the other boys.</p>

<p>Lammy had been bitterly disappointed when he
found that Bird could not return to spend the
Fourth of July, but he was not in the least daunted;
for, after all, what was a whole summer even, when
some day Bird would come back for good? The
boy firmly believed that something would turn up
to enable his father to buy the fruit farm, or if
that was impossible, he would try to coax his
father and mother to get her back without. There
was always plenty to eat, and his home seemed so
pleasant to him that he did not realize how hard
his parents had to struggle to make both ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
meet in the bad seasons when the bugs ate and
the drought dried. He did not, of course, know of
John O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s requirement that if Bird ever returned
she must be legally adopted, and share and
share alike with his brothers and himself; but if
he had, it would have made no difference.</p>

<p>Lammy was very fond of prowling in the deep
woods and along the river. He had intimate acquaintances
among the gray squirrels, always knew
where fox cubs could be found, and had once
reared a litter of skunk pups under an abandoned
barn. Their mother had evidently been trapped,&mdash;for
he never saw her,&mdash;and he fed the young with
milk and scraps, in the childish belief that they
were some sort of half-wild kittens, and was very
much disgusted, when they were old enough to
follow him home, that his father declined to have
them about, and that they disappeared the very
same night.</p>

<p>But the river interested him the most, and he
not only knew every swimming and pike hole,
perch run and spawning shallow, along its ten-mile
course from Northboro down to the Mill Farm
at Milltown, and the windings of every trout brook
that fed it, but he understood all that went on in
the half dozen mills or shops along the route.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
He could explain exactly how the water was turned
on and off and the gearing adjusted in the gristmill,
the stamping and perforating done at the
button factory, or the sand moulds prepared at
the forge where scrap iron was turned into cheap
ploughshares and other cast implements.</p>

<p>One very hot day the last part of July when
Lammy, together with &rsquo;Ram Slocum and Bob
Jedd, was going to the pet swimming-hole of the
Laurelville boys, a clear pebble-lined pool with a
shelving rock on one side that approached the
water by easy steps, they heard voices in the
woods and came suddenly upon a party of young
fellows from the Engineers&rsquo; Summer School, which
had its camp farther down the ridge of hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; shouted the foremost, addressing
Lammy, who also chanced to be in the lead;
&ldquo;can you tell us if there is any decent place to
swim hereabouts? The pond at the Mill Farm is
posted &lsquo;No Trespassing,&rsquo; most of the river bed is
either too rocky or too shallow, and the only good
place we&rsquo;ve struck below here has a mud bottom,
and looked too much like an eel hole to suit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis an eel hole, this side of the course,&rdquo;
Lammy answered readily, &ldquo;and t&rsquo;other side there&rsquo;s
pickerel could bite yer toes if they was minded to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll show yer a bully place. We&rsquo;re going there
now, and it isn&rsquo;t much further up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charge him a quarter for the steer,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Ram
Slocum, in a loud whisper, kicking Lammy&rsquo;s bare
shins to stop him, for he had stepped forward
eagerly to lead the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Lammy replied spicily, to &rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s
astonishment; &ldquo;water&rsquo;s free up here, even if your
pop won&rsquo;t let us swim in the mill-pond, and does
charge folks three cents a barrel for taking water
when their wells are dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Ram, a strong boy of sixteen, with bright red
hair, who usually domineered over all the boys of
his age and under,&mdash;particularly under,&mdash;had never
before been so answered by any of his companions,
much less Lammy, to whom he often referred as
&ldquo;softy,&rdquo; and his temper rose accordingly. His
nickname &ldquo;&rsquo;Ram,&rdquo; short for Abiram, referred to
his fighting proclivities and the way in which he
frequently used his bullet head to knock out an
antagonist instead of his fists; and though he did
not see fit to follow the matter then and there, in
his mind he put down Lammy for punishment
when he should next catch him alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lammy, silently threading through the
dense underbrush, followed by Bob Jedd, reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the swimming-hole, while &rsquo;Ram slowly brought up
the rear, crashing along sullenly, kicking the dead
branches right and left so that the little ground
beasts fled before him, now and then pausing either
to pound a luckless land turtle with a stone, or
shake from its perch some bird who, silent and
dejected, had sought deep cover for its moulting
time.</p>

<p>When he reached the others, he found not only
that Lammy had made friends with the students,
who, by the way, were a new lot who had recently
come to camp, but that they were asking him
all sorts of questions to draw out his knowledge
of the neighbourhood, and were actually making
Lammy a good offer if he would come to the camp
daily during their stay, be &ldquo;chainboy&rdquo; on their surveying
expeditions, and show them many things
about the country that it would be a waste of time
for them to search out for themselves.</p>

<p>Now Mr. and Mrs. Slocum had been very much
stirred up by these same surveyors, and being suspicious,
as shifty people usually are, wondered very
much if the men were only practising as they
claimed, or if they were in the pay of some land
company, and prospecting, that they might see where
land could be bought in large blocks. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
tried all summer to have &rsquo;Ram employed about the
camp, that he might keep his eyes and ears open,
but so far to no avail. Consequently, when the boy
heard the coveted position offered to Lammy, his
rage and disappointment got the better of his usually
shrewd discretion, and pushing into the group,
he almost shouted, his voice pitched high with
eagerness:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lammy ain&rsquo;t the one you want; he ain&rsquo;t strong,
and he&rsquo;s got no go. I&rsquo;m two years older and worth
twice as much, but I&rsquo;ll take the job at the same
price and get pop to let you swim in the mill-pond if
you&rsquo;ll hire me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think not,&rdquo; said the spokesman, a
bronzed, broad-shouldered young fellow of about
nineteen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you might charge us for the
air we breathed while we were in swimming; besides,
I never employ a sneak if I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then &rsquo;Ram knew that he had been overheard, and
he slunk away toward home, owing Lammy a double
grudge, and the sounds of shouts of merriment and
the splashing of water did not tend to cool his wrath.</p>

<p>As for Lammy, he sat on the edge of the rock,
trailing his brown toes in the water in the seventh
heaven of content; for he was to help carry those
mysterious instruments about for a whole month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and go in and out of the Summer School camp,
knowing what was said and done there, instead of
gazing at it across the fields. Then, too, perhaps
he might some day meet Mr. Clarke, and possibly,
though it was a daring thought, get leave to
go into the mysterious building in his locomotive
works at Northboro that bore the sign &ldquo;Strictly
Private&mdash;No Admittance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird and he had often talked of such a possibility.
How glad she would be to know! He would write
to her all about it.</p>

<p>He did, but had no reply; for the letter reached
Bird at one of the times when her uncle was away.
Billy had been suffering more than usual, and his
mother was consequently very cross and difficult to
bear with. Bird put the letter by to answer &ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo;;
but every day bore its own burden, and
the days piled up into weeks.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Joshua worked steadily on the fruit farm all the
season, preparing for future crops as conscientiously
as if he himself was to be the owner. Of this, however,
he had no hope; it was impossible for him to
bid on the place, as he had little or no ready money,
and the only way to raise this would be to mortgage
his own little farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>This several of his neighbours had suggested, offering
to loan him the money; but Joshua had struggled
along some fifteen years under the weight of a mortgage,
and now that he was freed he did not wish to
pick up the burden again. Then, too, his farm with
its old ramshackle outbuildings was not worth more
than three thousand dollars, while the fruit farm
with its rich land, good barn, poultry house, and
newly shingled dwelling was valued by good judges
at any figure from five to six thousand dollars. For
though Aunt Jimmy had scrimped herself in many
ways, she was too good a business woman to let her
property get out of repair.</p>

<p>Neither of the Lane brothers were as well off as
Joshua, so by the last of October the community had
decided that the fruit farm must go out of the
family, and attention was divided between who
would buy it and what Joshua would do with his
third of the proceeds,&mdash;better his house, or buy
more land.</p>

<p>The Slocums were considered to be the most
likely purchasers; for Abiram Slocum was known
to have much money stored away in various paying
farms as well as in the Northboro bank, though the
way in which he came by it was not approved, even
by the most close-fisted of his neighbours, for &rsquo;Biram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was what was called a &ldquo;land shark.&rdquo; He sold
worthless parcels of land that would grow nothing
but docks and mullein to the hard-working Poles
and Hungarians who were fast colonizing the outskirts
of Northboro, taking part cash payment, the
rest on mortgage, and encouraging them to build.
Then when the interest became overdue, owing to
inevitable poor crops, he foreclosed, put out the
family, and sold the place anew.</p>

<p>So sure did Mrs. Slocum appear to be that she
would own the fruit farm, that she took it upon
herself to watch the place to see, as she explained
when caught by Joshua Lane peeking in at the
kitchen window, &ldquo;that nothing properly belonging
to it was took off.&rdquo; He told her in very plain
language that whoever bought the farm would buy
what there was on it at the time, and no more, as
his aunt had trusted him with the management
until the final settlement, and that what he did
was no man&rsquo;s business save that of the heirs.</p>

<p>In the interval, before it was time to tie up vines
and bed the various berries with their winter covering
of manure, he turned his attention to Aunt
Jimmy&rsquo;s flower garden, a strip of ground enclosed
by a neat picket fence, where a box-edged path
starting under a rose trellis ran down the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and disappeared in a grape arbour at the farther
end, and everything that was fragrant and hardy
and worth growing flanked the walk, while behind,
the sweet peas and nasturtiums climbed up to
the very fence top in their effort to see and be
seen.</p>

<p>This garden had been the apple of Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
eye, and in spite of all &ldquo;spells&rdquo; and oddities, she
had tended it wholly herself, her one gentle feminine
impulse, as far as the outside world knew, having
been giving nosegays to the children that passed
the house on their way home from school. If they
handled the flowers carelessly, they never received
a second bunch, but if they cherished them, slips,
seeds, and bulbs were sure to follow, so that Aunt
Jimmy&rsquo;s flowers lived long after her in childish
garden plots.</p>

<p>Prompted by Lauretta Ann,&mdash;for Joshua was too
hard-headed and practical to have learned anything
about flowers, except that they must be fed and
watered like other stock, whether animal or vegetable,&mdash;he
regulated the various borders, dividing
and resetting the roots of hardy plants under his
wife&rsquo;s direction, as Aunt Jimmy had done each
autumn, while Lammy stood by, eagerly waiting for
the &ldquo;weedings,&rdquo; which he carried home with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
care and set out in a corner south of the barn, &ldquo;to
make,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;a little garden for Bird, in case
we don&rsquo;t get the fruit farm.&rdquo; His mother encouraged
him in this and praised his efforts, giving him
some strips of chicken wire to make a trellis, so
that his vines might in time cover the end of the
old, gray-shingled barn. Even she, however, did
not know of another little garden strip on a far-away
hillside that he had tended all summer for the sake
of his little friend.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>In spite of Joshua Lane&rsquo;s rebuke to Mrs. Slocum,
she continued spying and insinuating, and not many
days later, chancing to drive by the fruit farm half
an hour after school was out, and seeing Lammy
going up the road, carrying a basket, spade, and
water can, followed by faithful Twinkle, she hurried
home and bade &rsquo;Ram &ldquo;step lively and follow that
Lane boy up, an&rsquo; see where he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;, and what
he&rsquo;s got, and what he&rsquo;s agoin&rsquo; to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Slocum was more than usually determined
upon annoying the Lanes, since Joshua, as administrator
for Terence O&rsquo;More, had refused payment of
the rent owed for the little cottage, until the insurance
company had satisfied themselves as to the
cause of the fire and paid Abiram&rsquo;s claim. The furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
destroyed, at the lowest estimate, would have
been more than enough to cancel the debt.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Ram, only too glad to do his mother&rsquo;s errand,
after the manner of all bullies, waited until Lammy
was out of reach of protection and well up on the
sheltered &ldquo;hill road&rdquo; before he overtook him, asking
in a &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve-got-to-tell&rdquo; tone what he had in the
basket and where he was going. Upon Lammy&rsquo;s
declining to tell, he announced his intention of
following until he found out for himself.</p>

<p>Now it must be remembered that Lammy had the
name of being girlish, if not exactly cowardly, that
he was only fourteen, and though tall, was of a slender
build; while &rsquo;Ram was not only broad-shouldered
and sixteen, but the village braggart to boot, so that
it really took some pluck for Lammy to continue up
that houseless road with &rsquo;Ram muttering threats and
marching close behind. Still Lammy walked
straight on past all the farms, to where the runaway
Christmas trees stood sentinels around the
hillside graveyard. There is no denying that his
hand shook as he unlatched the gate, but he did
not falter or look back, but went to the corner
where were the mounds that marked the graves of
Bird O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s father and mother.</p>

<p>Why the turf was so much greener and smoother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
than anywhere else in the enclosure no one but
Lammy knew, and for a moment &rsquo;Ram paused outside
the fence in sheer surprise; but as Lammy,
kneeling down, took a couple of roots of the red
peony from his basket, and prepared to plant one at
the top of each flowery mound, his surprise vanished
in derision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you a fool for sure!&rdquo; he shouted, not
coming in the enclosure, for, stupid and superstitious
like all real cowards, he thought it bad luck to
cross a graveyard,&mdash;&ldquo;a fool for sure, planting posies
yer stole; top of paupers, too, when even that stuck-up
girl that was yer sweetheart&rsquo;s gone off to live
with rich folks and has clean forgotten them and
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lammy&rsquo;s trembling fingers fumbled with the earth
and his head swam. The first part of &rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s jeer
made his blood boil, but after all it was a lie, and lies
do not sting for long; for poor though O&rsquo;More was,
his debts would be paid to a penny, and Lammy
had <em>bought</em> the peony roots from his father as executor
by doing extra weeding on the fruit farm.</p>

<p>The last sentence, however, hurt cruelly; for
though Lammy did not believe it, he had no way of
disproving it even to himself, and so could not say a
word to &rsquo;Ram in reply; for during the five months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
since Bird went away only two brief notes had come
from her, and these told about city streets and sights,
and little or nothing of herself. While, to make it
the more strange, when, in the hot August weather,
Mrs. Lane had sent her an invitation to come up
for the promised visit, enclosing the tickets, which
represented some weeks of egg money, and offered
herself to go down to New Haven to meet the child,
a stiff little note returning the tickets had come by
way of reply, and though it was grateful in wording
and said something vague about going with Billy for
sea air, etc., he could not guess the disappointment
that it covered, and that the sea air was merely a
chance ferry ride, or the breeze that blew over Battery
Park, where they herded daily with hundreds of
other children of poorer New York. Lammy had
been cut to the heart, and &rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s taunt rankled
indeed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane, however, had read between the lines,
her keen insight, confidence in Bird, and motherly
love serving as spectacles. She still felt, as she
always had done, that Bird was unhappy, and yet too
proud to confess it, and that she did not dare
write often or come among them, for fear that they
should discover what they could not as yet better.
For Mrs. Lane remembered O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s conditional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
promise only too well, and the possibility of fulfilling
her part of adopting the little girl within the year
seemed to grow more and more remote.</p>

<p>Silently Lammy finished his work, picking up
every dead leaf that lay on the mounds, and then
taking his spade and basket, turned to go home, but
there stood his tormentor by the gate.</p>

<p>If anything angers a bully, it is silence. If Lammy
had engaged in a war of words, the chances are that
&rsquo;Ram would have gone away, having had, as he considered
it, his fun out. As it was, he really felt that
he had been neglected and affronted, so, making believe
open the gate as Lammy closed it, he said, &ldquo;I
can dig up them posies twict as quick as you
planted &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can, but you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Lammy,
suddenly growing pale and rigid, while he stood outside
the gate, but square in front of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho, and who &rsquo;ll stop me?&rdquo; sneered &rsquo;Ram, in
amused surprise, standing with his arms akimbo.</p>

<p>Without saying another word, Lammy, the meek,
the boy-girl in name, flew at &rsquo;Ram with such suddenness,
beating and buffetting him, that the big boy
was knocked down before he knew it. Recovering
his feet quickly, he tried to grapple with the lanky
little lad, but Lammy twisted and turned with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
litheness of a cat, landing rapid if rather wild blows at
each plunge, while Twinkle nipped at &rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s heels,
until finally &rsquo;Ram, seeing that he was outmatched in
agility, and determined to conquer without more
ado, lowered his head for the celebrated &ldquo;butt&rdquo; that
generally winded his antagonist.</p>

<p>Lammy&rsquo;s fighting Yankee ancestors must have
left the lower end of the graveyard and marched up
to encourage him on this occasion; for he was nearly
spent and was pausing to get breath when the lunge
came, so that his final effort was to give a side
twist, and the blow of the red bullet head was
received square and full by the locust gate post
instead of by Lammy&rsquo;s stomach.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Ram dropped to the ground, where he lay for
several minutes seeing stars, planets, and comets,
while a bump as big as an apple appeared in the
middle of his forehead and the cords of his neck
ached like teeth. Meanwhile Lammy, his nervous
strength gone, ran all the way home, and throwing
himself on his bed, whither he was followed by his
mother, who saw his livid face as he dashed through
the kitchen, sobbed as if his heart would break, not
from fear, but because in the reaction he remembered
what Bird had said of people who fought either with
their tongues or fists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until long afterward that he thought
it strange, and wondered why his mother had not
scolded him, only hugged him to her comfortable,
pillowy breast, when he told his story, and put nearly
all of her precious bottle of Northboro cologne on
his head to soothe it, and gave him buttered toast,
when, after having his cry out, he came down to
supper, which dainty was generally regarded as only
for the minister or else a &ldquo;sick-a-bed&rdquo; luxury. His
father meanwhile actually broke into a laugh and
said, &ldquo;Hear yer&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; a leetle Declaration
o&rsquo; Independencing on yer own account. Wal, it&rsquo;s
sometimes a necessary act fer folks same as countries;
Lauretta Ann, I reckon Lammy and me
could relish a pot of coffee to-night&rdquo;&mdash;coffee being
a Sunday-morning treat.</p>

<p>When it came to the part of his story concerning
&rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s taunt and his fear that Bird had forgotten
them, his mother reassured him for the hundredth
time with her own ample faith, but he quite startled
her by saying emphatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right, mother, as far as it goes,
but we&rsquo;ve just <em>got</em> to buy that fruit farm somehow.&rdquo;
And he fell asleep that night, happy in making
impossible plans for the purchase.</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well for Lammy&rsquo;s self-conceit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that he did not hear his mother talk with Mrs.
Slocum, who came in about nine o&rsquo;clock, tearful,
yet at the same time in a threatening rage, demanding
that he be &ldquo;whipped thoro&rsquo; for half murdering
her harmless boy when he was taking an
innercent walk, and that if he didn&rsquo;t get the whippin&rsquo;,
she&rsquo;d get a warrant immedjet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane waited until she had finished her tirade,
and then calling Joshua, who had retreated to the
wood-shed, said: &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Slocum here needs a warrant
writ hasty; jest you escort her down to the Squire&rsquo;s,
as her husband don&rsquo;t seem intrested to go with her.
I hate to see a neighbour obleeged to play the man
and risk goin&rsquo; out in the dark alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then as her adversary, seeing herself outflanked,
rose to go, she added with apparent sympathy:
&ldquo;Of course I know it&rsquo;s hard for you to feel &rsquo;Ram&rsquo;s
beat by one half his size, even if the gate post did
help Lammy, and folks &rsquo;ll be surprised to hear it,
but you mustn&rsquo;t blame him too much; it was maybe
me, his mother, in him worked Lammy&rsquo;s fists so
good.&rdquo; And Lauretta Ann looked her visitor straight
in the eyes. Some weeks later Mrs. Slocum had
reason to remember that look.</p>

LAMMY CONSULTS OLD LUCKY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> November came, Joshua Lane had completed
his work of preparing the fruit farm for
the auction, according to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s wish that it
should be in full running order when sold.</p>

<p>The old fowls were mostly sold off, and the henhouse
was full of the vigorous laying pullets that
mean so much in early winter. The fall cow had
calved, and the two or three yearlings were as sleek
as does.</p>

<p>When the time came for the division of the furniture
between the wives of the three Lane brothers
by drawing lots, public interest again awakened,
and Mrs. Slocum expressed great anxiety lest it
should not be done fairly, saying to her husband:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fussy, mixed-up business anyway. Why
didn&rsquo;t they auction off the stuff and let folks in to
see it done fair? They do say, for all Miss Jemima
lived so plain, she had stores of good stuff shut
up in those top rooms that even Dinah Lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
never&rsquo;s had a peek at when she went to houseclean.
Those old mahogany pieces are worth money at
Northboro, and Lauretta Ann&rsquo;s cute enough to
know it, but I don&rsquo;t believe those other slab-sided
Lane women do; so do you watch your chance and
make them an offer so soon as it&rsquo;s divided. There&rsquo;s
a wardrobe there, solid mahogany, twice as big as
one they ask fifty dollars for in the &rsquo;curious&rsquo; shop.
Most likely they&rsquo;d value cheap, new stuff better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it had not been rather pathetic to Mrs. Lane,
this breaking up of a house where she had been
so much at home, the day of the division would
have been one of unalloyed merriment.</p>

<p>In the first place, owing to the way in which
Aunt Jimmy had directed the drawing should be
managed, the articles were not valued in the usual
way and divided so that each of the three women
shared alike, but merely numbered, the duplicate
slips being shaken up in a basket and drawn by
Probate Judge Ricker for Lauretta Ann, the others
drawing for themselves, as Joshua preferred that
there should be no possible chance of his wife
being criticised. While she, cheerful and thoughtful
as ever of the comfort of others, prepared a
nice lunch on the afternoon appointed, which she
and Lammy carried to the fruit farm, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a cheerful fire in the kitchen stove, with a big pot of
fragrant coffee purring away on top of it, when Jason
and Henry Lane, the younger brothers, following each
other closely, drove into the yard with their wives.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henry Lane was a delicate, sad-looking
little woman, quite above the average. She had
been one of the teachers in the Milltown public
school at the time of her marriage, but the struggle
to wrest a living from a small hillside farm,
coupled with ill health, had broken her spirit, and
she sank into a rocking-chair and began to jiggle
the baby that she carried to and fro.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jason, on the contrary, was tall and gaunt,
with high cheek-bones. Life had not been very
kind to her either, but still she looked as if she
could hold her own; and her husband, who only
reached her shoulder, fairly quaked and fell away
before her like ill-made jelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do draw up to the table, sisters-in-law both,&rdquo;
cried Lauretta Ann, after greeting each heartily.
&ldquo;You must have hurried dinner to get down here
by now, and I always do feel hungrier the first
cool days than when winter has set square in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>should</em> feel better for a cup of coffee,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Henry, in a plaintive voice; &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t had
any for more than two weeks. Henry forgot it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
when he went to the store, and he doesn&rsquo;t get
there as often as he used, now that the mail is
delivered around the country by wagon. I&rsquo;ve been
using tea right along, and I think it&rsquo;s made me
nervous; besides, the last I bought from the travelling
spice-and-sugar man tasted more like buckwheat
shucks and musty hay than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Henry Lane&rsquo;s head sank still farther into
the collar of his coat, which was three sizes too big
anyway, and he began whittling recklessly at a
hard-wood clothespin with a broken knife, which
quickly caused a deeply cut finger and much consternation,
as the sight of blood always made his
wife faint away, and the present occasion was no
exception to the rule.</p>

<p>After Lauretta Ann had bathed and bound up
the finger, and sent Lammy home for a little of
the cherry cordial for which she was famous, she
made another effort to serve the lunch, and finally
succeeded in cheering the mournful company by
sheer force of good temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;ll draw Grandma Lane&rsquo;s canopy-top
cradle and the big rocker that matches, they&rsquo;d
be such comforts to you as you are fixed,&rdquo; Mrs.
Joshua said to Mrs. Henry, as putting a friendly
arm about her, they went into the sitting room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
where Judge Ricker was busy kneading up the
numbered papers in the basket as carefully as if
he was working lard into flour for tea biscuits, and
seated themselves in a semicircle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you begin, sister-in-law Jason, and you follow
next, sister-in-law Henry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Joshua, laying
her hand, which would tremble in spite of herself,
on Lammy&rsquo;s shoulder. Lammy, by the way, had
grown broader and stronger and lost much of his
timidity of manner during the two months past.
Whether it was the sense of responsibility that
working with the college men had given him, or
his determination to have Bird come back, his
mother could not decide, while his father chuckled
whenever the matter was referred to, saying,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t neither; it was squarin&rsquo; up at &rsquo;Ram Slocum
that made a man of him;&rdquo; and though Lauretta
always said, &ldquo;Sho, pa! ain&rsquo;t you ashamed of aidin&rsquo;
and abettin&rsquo; a fight?&rdquo; her smiling expression belied
her words.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jason stepped forward and drew&mdash;the
canopy cradle! A roar of laughter greeted her
venture, in which she joined grimly, for her youngest
offspring was a six-foot youth of seventeen, while
Mrs. Henry sighed and felt secretly injured, though
she said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came her turn, and she drew a worked motto
in a gilt frame, which read, &ldquo;The Lord Will Provide,&rdquo;
whereat she smiled feebly and whimpered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to think so, but I do wish Henry Lane
would help Him out better.&rdquo; Mrs. Joshua drew
the best china, Mrs. Henry the tall clock, which
she straightway declared to be a foot higher than
any of her rooms,&mdash;she finally traded it with
Mrs. Jason for the cradle and rocking-chair,&mdash;until
at the end of two hours the last number left the
basket and three tired and confused women wandered
about trying to collect their property.</p>

<p>The great wardrobe had fallen to Mrs. Jason&rsquo;s
share, but upon close inspection it proved to be
merely stained cherry and not mahogany at all,
and its owner remarked that she wished some one
would take it off her hands, as it was too big to
go in her door, and more than it was worth to
truck it home, much less get it in to Northboro,
where it would be possible to sell it. Her husband,
however, ventured to say it would make a good
harness closet for the barn and keep the rats from
gnawing the leather; and so with much stretching
of muscles and groans of &ldquo;now heave together&rdquo;
it was loaded with the other articles upon the
wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>There was quite a lively interchange of articles
between the women before the rooms were finally
cleared, but in the end, owing to Mrs. Joshua&rsquo;s good
sense, they all declared themselves well satisfied.
Mrs. Jason had secured a good sewing-machine, and
Mrs. Henry a parlour organ for which her melancholy
spirit pined; while Mrs. Joshua, who had a machine
and inwardly detested parlour organs, saying that
when needful she could do her own groaning, was
made happy by the best parlour set, her own chairs
and lounge having been fatally collapsed by her
family of men folks of assorted ages.</p>

<p>One thing they all regretted, which was that
Aunt Jimmy had ordered all articles of every kind
not mentioned in her list should be either burned
or buried, according to their kind, and there were
many things dear to their feminine hearts in the
mass of rubbish that had been accumulating in
garret and cellar, barn and loft, these many years
as well as much that was salable as junk. It was
of no use to object; for Joshua was determined
to carry out the will in both spirit and letter,
and though it had amused the eccentric old lady
to collect and hoard the stuff, she was equally determined
that it should never be exposed to the gaze
of the curious. Joshua knew that though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
thought him slow and without ambition, she trusted
him, and he was not going to disappoint her.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>As the loaded wagons filed out of the yard, a
lean figure might have been seen peering through
the branches of a small maple tree in the wood lot
just above. It was Abiram Slocum, who, goaded
by his wife, was trying to see which cart contained
the wardrobe; for she had come back from Northboro
the day before all eagerness to get possession
of it, for the owner of the &ldquo;curious shop&rdquo; had
said if the wardrobe was of the size and quality
she described, he would pay her fifty dollars for it.
Now if the owner would let it go for fifteen or even
twenty-five dollars, the profit would give her new
paper and a carpet for her best room; for rich as
Slocum was reputed to be, he was close-fisted with
his wife, and she was obliged to pick up her own
pin money like her poorer neighbours, with the exception
that she had not succeeded in the egg business,
owing to her tendency, whenever possible, to give
eleven to the dozen, and sell limed eggs at a high
price to ignorant people who desired them for
setting.</p>

<p>Abiram presently spied the wardrobe on Jason
Lane&rsquo;s load. He was sorry for this, for Mrs. Jason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was one of the few people who had ever got the
better of him in trade, and a horse trade at that,
so he feared she would never sell the furniture,
or if she did, would extort full value.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he slipped hastily from the tree,
cut across lots toward the road they must take on
their way home, and fifteen minutes later met them
when they stopped to rest the horse, as if he was
merely sauntering toward the pasture for his cows,
and was soon engaged in general conversation upon
farm topics that gradually led up toward the furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavy load you&rsquo;ve got there,&rdquo; he remarked;
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t that there closet big for your haouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jason was about to say that it was, and that they
were going to put it in the barn, when he felt his
wife looking daggers, and refrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis big, but we can use it,&rdquo; she answered dryly,
starting up the horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about selling it and buying somethin&rsquo;
handier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t anxious. Get along, Whiteface,&rdquo; she said,
touching the horse with the whip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give yer fifteen dollars for it, here and now,
if you&rsquo;ll leave it to my house,&rdquo; Abiram shouted as the
wagon began to move away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t pay me to turn back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty dollars then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope, I&rsquo;m in a hurry, and there&rsquo;s a pile of good
seasoned wood in the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows its value, sure enough,&rdquo; he said to
himself, as the wagon began to climb the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give yer twenty-five, and yer can leave it here by
the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you might unpack, pa,&rdquo; the gaunt
woman said, a smile hovering about her mouth, adding
to Abiram, &ldquo;Hand up the money, and down she
goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five seconds two ten-dollar bills and a five,
after a searching scrutiny, found their way into Mrs.
Jason&rsquo;s pocket, and the clumsy piece of furniture
leaned tipsily against the pasture fence exposed to
the full glare of the sun.</p>

<p>Just as Jason Lane had remounted the seat and
the wagon had begun to move again, a shout made
them look round. There stood Abiram in the middle
of the road, stamping and choking with rage so that
he could barely speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! hey, stop!&rdquo; he yelled; &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t mahogany;
it&rsquo;s only stained wood. Hey, give me my money
back or I&rsquo;ll hev ye arrested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said it was mahogany?&rdquo; called Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Jason, stopping the horse and fairly beaming with
the pleasure of the contention.</p>

<p>Abiram hesitated a moment, felt himself caught,
stammered, and said, &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Slocum did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead and arrest Mrs. Slocum, then,&rdquo;
chimed in Jason, his speech for once meeting his
wife&rsquo;s approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lordy, Lordy, what &rsquo;ll she say, &rsquo;n&rsquo; what &rsquo;ll I
do with it?&rdquo; he moaned to himself, completely
caught in the trap set by his own greed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; shouted Mrs. Jason as she moved
away, &ldquo;&rsquo;nless you put wheels on it to make a
wagon and hitch that sorrel mare I sold you to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>The day of the sale drew near. All that remained
to be done was the destroying of the rubbish, and
this was no small task.</p>

<p>One entire day a bonfire had raged in the back lot,
and what would not burn was the next day taken
in the ox-cart thrice filled by Joshua himself and
dumped carefully in the great bog-hole.</p>

<p>This quaking bog was one of the wonders of
the neighbourhood and its common dumping ground,
even though it could only be reached by fording
the river above the mill-pond. To the eye it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
merely an oozy-looking swamp tract, such as are
plentiful near the back-water of rivers, but this
particular bit was an ogre that swallowed up everything
that was cast in it, only a few hours being
necessary to engulf, without leaving a sign, an
unlucky cow that had once strayed into it. So
that now it was securely fenced about except at
one spot, used for dumping, which was protected
with logs secured to driven piles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane watched the loading of the wagon very
ruefully, for she now fully realized that all her hopes
concerning the fruit farm had come to as complete
an end as the load of broken china and rusty
tinware. When she saw the old pewter tea-pot,
the dents supplemented by a crack, go by on top
of a basket of broken flower pots, she begged her
husband to let her keep it, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s worth nothin&rsquo; now, even for drawin&rsquo;
tea, Aunt Jimmy must hev meant somethin&rsquo; kind
when she left it to me, and I&rsquo;d like it to mind me
of the idea, only she got fogged up some way and
didn&rsquo;t plan right; fer if she set store by anything,
it was by that pot on account of its bein&rsquo; buried
half of the Revolution with great-grandmother
Cuddy&rsquo;s best teaspoons and twenty gold guineas all
safe inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lauretta Ann,&rdquo; said Joshua, pausing to rest the
heavy basket on the tail-board of the cart, &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
often I put my foot down, but now they&rsquo;ve set,
heel and toe, sock and leather, both of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to do my work legal, but you&rsquo;ve been treated
shabby, and I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to hev that tea-pot set
up on a shelf for a moniment to that same. If
you&rsquo;re too Christian to resent, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do it for
yer, which she, bein&rsquo; my aunt, the quarrel is for
me to take upon me, so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua had never before made such a long speech
in all their married life, and his wife, fairly awed by
his earnestness, said no more, but turning away, took
the private pathway homeward that led through the
meadow and garden, closing the gap in the wall with
brush as she went, for soon now she would have no
longer any right to come and go.</p>

<p>That afternoon as Lammy came home from school
he saw in the distance his father and the ox-team
taking the last load along the highway, and as he
realized how soon the auction would take place, his
heart sank and his feet dragged heavily along.
Turning to take a short cut through the lane,
he came face to face with an old coloured man
with snow-white, woolly hair, who was scratching
up the leaves with his cane, in search of chestnuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>His name was Nebuchadnezzar Lucky, or Old
Lucky, as he was called for short, and he was the
husband of Dinah, who was general factotum of the
village, and supported her man, who was double
her age, by cooking, nursing, or housecleaning, as
the season or circumstances demanded, absolutely
taking pride in the fact, as if it was his right and
his due. For was not Old Lucky a superior being
who made charms, brewed herb medicines, and
told fortunes, in addition to having turns of &ldquo;seeing
things,&rdquo; which caused him to be regarded
with awe by children and the credulous of all
ages, even in this prim New England town where
witches were once burned?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Massa Lammy? &rsquo;Pears like the squir&rsquo;ls
and chippin monkeys has got all the chestnuts this
season, and dey ain&rsquo;t left one for old Uncle Lucky
to bile soft so&rsquo;s him can eat &rsquo;em. You ain&rsquo;t got a
handful laid up you could spare &rsquo;thout missin&rsquo;, I
reckon now?&rdquo; And the old man gave a persuasive,
yet terrifying leer with eyes that were so badly
crossed that they fairly seemed tangled.</p>

<p>An idea struck Lammy, as the tales of Lucky&rsquo;s
power came back to him, for even the practical folk
who scoffed, allowed that there was something queer
in it. He would consult the old man as to what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
could do to get the fruit farm and Bird back at the
same time. But stop! Where was the money to come
from? For it was well known among his customers
that Lucky could not &ldquo;see things&rdquo; until he had
rubbed his eyelids with a piece of silver. Lammy&rsquo;s
money was all in the bank. Ah! he had it! John
O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s silver dollar that was hidden away in
Bird&rsquo;s paint-box!</p>

<p>Away he flew like a scurrying rabbit, leaving Old
Lucky muttering in amazement, and in a half-hour
returned, carrying a salt-bag full of chestnuts in one
hand and the coin wrapped in paper in the other.</p>

<p>The old man, by this time having grown tired of
his useless hunt for nuts, had gone home, and
Lammy followed him to his cabin that was perched
on the edge of the bank overhanging the mill stream.
Lucky was sitting in an arm-chair by the window
when Lammy entered and stammered out his wish
and request for advice, at the same time offering
his bag of nuts and the coin which he first polished
on his trousers.</p>

<p>If Lucky was surprised at the size of the offering,
his usual fee being a quarter, while he never refused
a dime, he did not show it, but felt the money carefully,
passed it across his dim eyes, munched a nut
or two, and falling back in his chair, covered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
head with a red and yellow handkerchief and began
to mutter, beckoning Lammy to come near and listen,
which he did, scarcely daring to breathe. The
mutterings went on for several minutes, and then
took the form of words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take&mdash;a&mdash;shotgun,&rdquo; said the voice in a tone
meant to be hollow, but which stopped at being
cracked, &ldquo;load him wif bullets you make umsself,
go up on de churchyard hill and shoot der shadder
of a Christmas tree on a&mdash;black,&mdash;dark night,&mdash;an&rsquo;
den,&mdash;an&rsquo; den&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; besought Lammy, in an agony
of suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den you&rsquo;ll hear sumpfin&rsquo;!&rdquo; shouted Lucky, suddenly
pulling the handkerchief from his face and
fixing Lammy with a cross-eyed stare that was paralyzing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But recommember,&rdquo; Lucky added, shaking his
forefinger ominously, &ldquo;make dem bullets out o&rsquo;
sumpfin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; find, not bought nor lead uns, but sumpfin&rsquo;
white like silver, or dis year charm hit won&rsquo;t
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>where</em> shall I find it?&rdquo; gasped Lammy, so
much in earnest that he did not realize the absurdity
of what the old man said.</p>

<p>This question seemed to take the magician out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of his depth, and annoyed him not a little. After
casting his eyes helplessly about, they chanced to
rest on the stream below the window, when he
quickly closed them and whispered, &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; must look
in water&mdash;not in a pond, but in running water!&rdquo;
after which he refused to say another word.</p>

<p>When Lammy reached home, his mother was setting
the supper on the table, while his father and
brothers were going over the same old arguments
as to the possibility or impossibility of buying the
fruit farm. Lammy smiled to himself as he lifted
Twinkle to his shoulder and then put the dog on
a chair beside him, his usual place at meal-times,
where he waited, one ear up and one down, until it
was time to be fed.</p>

<p>No one noticed how red the boy&rsquo;s cheeks were
and how his eyes shone, as he hurried from supper
to learn his lessons, that he might have time in the
morning to begin his search for metal for the magic
bullets before going to school. He thought if he
had the material, all else would be easy, for there
was an old bullet-mould in the workroom in the
barn, where mending was done, also an iron pot that
had been used for melting solder.</p>

<p>He did not tell his mother of his plan, not that
he meant in any way to deceive her; but if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
knew nothing, the surprise at the result would be
all the greater.</p>

<p>For the next two or three days Lammy went up
and down the river banks from the Mill Farm to
the upper fork, apparently as aimlessly as in the
time that he was dubbed &ldquo;Look-out Johnny,&rdquo; and
the neighbours nodded, and said, &ldquo;The brace he
got fightin&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t last,&mdash;he&rsquo;s trampin&rsquo; again,&rdquo; while
his mother took it to heart and thought it was
because he was grieving for Bird, as they had heard
nothing definite or satisfactory from her for more
than a month, and then only a few words on a card
inquiring for Twinkle.</p>

<p>When Saturday came, Lammy started off in the
morning early, asking his mother for a lunch to
carry with him, which was nothing unusual. This
day, instead of heading downstream, he started
above the mill and followed the river up toward
the woods. All the forenoon he looked here and
there, and after eating his luncheon came out of
the woods near where the highway branched and
crossed the ford on the way to the bog dumping
ground.</p>

<p>He stood there a few minutes, idly watching the
dead leaves swirl along, and an occasional fish dart
by, when his eyes became fixed upon an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
lying close under a big stone in mid-stream; it
glistened as the sun shone upon it, and then turned
dull again. Whatever it was, it fascinated him
strangely, and jumping from stone to stone, he soon
reached it. &ldquo;Only an old tin pan,&rdquo; he muttered in
disgust; &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t make bullets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the stone upon which he
stood turned, making him jump splash into the water,
kicking the pan as he went. When he recovered
himself, he looked about for footing, and there where
the pan had been, to his amazement, lying almost
at his feet, was the pewter tea-pot!</p>

<p>&ldquo;However did that get here?&rdquo; he exclaimed; but
the answer was so simple that he guessed it at
once. The tea-pot, in company with the pan, had
been jolted from the ox-cart in crossing the ford
on its way to the dump, and so escaped being
swallowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Lammy, picking up the treasure
and making his way to land, where he danced
about in glee. &ldquo;This &rsquo;ll melt into bullets first rate,
and it&rsquo;s kind of white like silver if it&rsquo;s cleaned.
When it&rsquo;s melted, pop can&rsquo;t call it &lsquo;an eyesore&rsquo; or
a &lsquo;moniment,&rsquo; so it&rsquo;s no harm for me to take it
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not tell why, but he took off his coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and wrapped it carefully around the tea-pot, and
then slipped from the highway into the woods
again.</p>

<p>When he reached home, it was still early afternoon.
His father was cutting wood in the upper lot,
and his mother had gone to Northboro with eggs for
her Saturday customers, so Lammy had the place
to himself.</p>

<p>First he buried the tea-pot deep in the feed bin,
and taking the key of the house from its hiding-place
under the door-mat, stole up to his room for
dry shoes and socks, as it was a cold day and his
sopping feet were already making him shiver and
feel tight in the throat. Somehow the possession
of the tea-pot gave him an uneasy feeling. Did it
really belong to him? He hung about the house
for a time, then walked straight out the gate and
down to the Squire&rsquo;s office in the town house.
This same &ldquo;Squire&rdquo; was a man of education as
well as a lawyer, and Lammy&rsquo;s knock was answered
by a cheery &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; which he did, saying, all
in one breath and quite reckless of grammar,
&ldquo;Please, sir, if I find anything that&rsquo;s been took to
the dump, but fell off and not been swallowed,
would it be mine to make bullets of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire looked up from under his bushy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
eyebrows and smiled at the lad encouragingly.
&ldquo;Certainly it would be yours, my boy; what is
intentionally thrown away is fair plunder for any
one.&rdquo; And with a hasty &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; Lammy
was off again with an easy conscience, to find an
old axe, break up the tea-pot, and melt it if
possible before his parents&rsquo; return. Ah, but Lucky&rsquo;s
charm was surely working.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange child that,&rdquo; said the Squire, looking
after him; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll either turn out a fool or a genius.
There is no middle path for such as he. I must
keep my eye on him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a><br />

THE PEWTER TEA-POT</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lammy reached home he hurried into
the barn, carefully closing both door and windows.
In looking about for an old axe whose edge would
not be hurt by chopping metal, he stumbled over a
rusty anvil that was half buried in litter. This he
managed to drag into the light; then digging the
tea-pot from the feed bin, he began his work.</p>

<p>First he wrenched off the cover and battered it
into small pieces, which he put into the solder pot.
Chop, chop! the handle gave way next, then the
queer sprawling legs. He made several blows at
the thick, clumsy, curved spout without hitting it, for
his hands trembled with excitement combined with
the chill of his wet feet.</p>

<p>Finally he landed a square blow a little above
where the spout joined the body, but instead of cutting
the metal quite through, the blade wedged, so
he dropped the axe and seizing the tea-pot, proceeded
to wrench off the spout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got tea leaves stuck in it,&rdquo; he said to himself,
as he pulled and twisted at it. &ldquo;Nope, brown
paper,&rdquo; as a small roll of paper, the size, thickness,
and length of a cigarette fell to the floor. To this he
paid no attention, but continued to chop at the tea-pot
until it was all in bits, tightly packed in the
solder pot, and covered with an old plate.</p>

<p>As he went to push back the anvil he stepped on
the little bit of rolled-up paper and idly picking it
up, turned it between his fingers, but with his mind
wholly filled with the making of the magic bullets.
It was too late to melt the pewter now; he would
have to wait until Monday afternoon. How could
he ever eat two more breakfasts, dinners, and suppers
with the precious stuff in his possession?</p>

<p>As his hands worked, the stout oiled paper between
his fingers unrolled by their warmth, as a leaf
unfolds in the heat, and showed something green
inside.</p>

<p>Lammy looked, and his heart almost stopped beating,
while the sun, moon, and stars seemed to be
floating past, trailing cloud petticoats and dancing,
for the green stuff was money,&mdash;clean, crisp banknotes
rolled as hard as a pencil!</p>

<p>Lammy sank down all in a heap on a pile of
straw, his eyes closed and his fist clutching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
little bundle like a vice. It was several minutes
before he could steady himself sufficiently to part
the tightly twisted roll and count his treasure, which
was so compact that he had to use great care. Fortunately
the oil paper had kept the money dry in spite
of the bath in the river, in addition to a bit of cork
that had been rammed tightly into the spout, but
which Lammy had not noticed as it dropped out at
the first chop.</p>

<p>At last a bill peeled from the roll. Lammy
smoothed it out, and rubbed his eyes. Could it be?
He had never seen a bank bill for a larger sum than
twenty dollars before, but five hundred was printed
on this. Then he fell to work in earnest, and after
many stops to moisten his fingers, twelve of the
green, damp-smelling bits of paper lay spread upon
the barn floor, while Lammy was saying over to himself,
&ldquo;Twelve times five are sixty&mdash;sixty hundred
dollars&mdash;ten into sixty six times&mdash;six thousand dollars!
Oh, mother&mdash;Bird&mdash;the fruit farm!&rdquo; he
fairly shouted. This then was what Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
will had meant, after all.</p>

<p>Gathering the bills into his grimy handkerchief,
blackened by polishing the tea-pot, he buttoned them
inside his shirt and rushed into the house at the
moment his mother was getting out of the chaise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and bringing in the week&rsquo;s supply of groceries, for
which she had traded her eggs.</p>

<p>His father having come home from the wood lot,
took the horse to the barn, fed and bedded him
immediately,&mdash;for old Graylocks never went fast
enough to become heated,&mdash;and then came to the
kitchen sink to make his toilet for supper.</p>

<p>Lammy sat waiting his time by the stove with his
feet in the oven door, trying to suppress the shivers
that ran through him. Would his mother ever put
the things away and stop bustling? They could
not have supper until late that night, for the shop
where his brothers worked was running over time,
and they would not be home before seven.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane put the potatoes on to fry, arranged the
steak in the broiler (she was the only woman in
Laurelville who did not fry her meat), and then sat
down to rest, keeping one eye upon the clock.
Presently she caught sight of Lammy&rsquo;s face, and
promptly jumped up again to grab one of his hands
and ask anxiously: &ldquo;Be you feelin&rsquo; sick, Lammy
Lane? Your hands is frogs and your cheeks hot
coals. I do hope and pray it ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be a
fever spell o&rsquo; any kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spell be blowed!&rdquo; said Joshua, who was now
seated by the lamp, enjoying his weekly paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a-traipsin&rsquo; round all day among them
soggy marshes that fairly belches chills in fall o&rsquo;
the year, on a snack o&rsquo; cold food. What he needs
is a lining o&rsquo; hot vittles; likewise do I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lammy had left the stove and stood by
the table, his hands clasped tightly, and such a
strange expression on his face that both his
parents were startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sick&mdash;that is, not much,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;though I&rsquo;m awfully hungry, but I&rsquo;ve got something
to tell out first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began slowly, and told about his visit
to Old Lucky and his search for bullet material.</p>

<p>Here his father interrupted him with, &ldquo;Shucks,
Lammy Lane, ain&rsquo;t you got better sense than to
throw away dollars?&rdquo; but his mother gave Joshua
a look, and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you shet him off the
track until he&rsquo;s through. I knew he wasn&rsquo;t working
in his mind like he&rsquo;s done lately for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he told of chopping up the tea-pot, his
father chuckled, but his mother shivered and
broke in with, &ldquo;How could you ever set an axe
in it? It seems to me &rsquo;bout as bad as cuttin&rsquo; up
poor Aunt Jimmy for sausages!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came to the end, and pulling out his
handkerchief, spread the contents before his parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Mr. and Mrs. Lane stood grasping the table edge
and staring white and wide eyed, until Joshua broke
the silence with &ldquo;Jehosophat! Nancy Hanks! but
I&rsquo;m kneesprung dumbfounded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better be!&rdquo; snapped Lauretta Ann,
as nearly as she <em>could</em> snap at her husband; &ldquo;after
all you&rsquo;ve said against the memory of sainted Aunt
Jimmy, and sneered and snipped at her will and
meanings! Don&rsquo;t you see now how she fixed things
so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d get the farm by biddin&rsquo; it in fair without
bein&rsquo; hashed over in public for gettin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n my
equal share? <em>She</em> trusted me to fetch that pot
home and, by usin&rsquo; it daily, find it wouldn&rsquo;t pour
out, as I would have did and diskiver the money.
Oh, Joshua, Joshua, let this be a lesson to you an&rsquo;
all husbands not to browbeat their trustin&rsquo; wives,
as women&rsquo;s allers the furthest seein&rsquo; sect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fur seein&rsquo;, shucks!&rdquo; snorted Joshua, who had
enjoyed his recent authority too well to part with
it; &ldquo;between you and Aunt Jimmy yer&rsquo;d made a
fine mess o&rsquo; it, and it took a male, though not a
full-grown one, to pull yer out of it, for yer allowed
yer&rsquo;d only stick up the pot for a moniment an&rsquo; not
use it on account o&rsquo; its taste tainting the tea. It
sartinly took us men folks to dig yer out o&rsquo; it;
didn&rsquo;t it, Lammy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now as we know Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s intentions was
that this be kept close, close it&rsquo;ll be kept, and we&rsquo;d
better pack up them bills until we can bank &rsquo;em
Monday, in case Mis&rsquo;is Slocum should be drawd
to look in the winder to see if we are havin&rsquo; a hot
or cold supper, and real or crust coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mother,&rdquo; said Lammy, as soon as he could
be heard, &ldquo;when shall we get Bird back? Need
we wait until the auction?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive, child, I&rsquo;ll write as soon as I get
my head, but there&rsquo;s two letters unanswered now,
and I&rsquo;m afeared they&rsquo;ve moved again. Somehow,
with all we&rsquo;ve got to face just now, I think &rsquo;twould
be better waitin&rsquo; until everything&rsquo;s settled up certain
and we&rsquo;ve got the place safe and sound.
Then pa and me and you could kind er celebrate,
and take a trip to N&rsquo;York and get her. I ain&rsquo;t
never been there but onct in my life, an&rsquo; that was
to a funeral when it wasn&rsquo;t seemin&rsquo; fer me to look
about to see things, and it rained and I spoiled
my best bunnit. I reckon, now we can afford it,
&rsquo;twould set us all up to go on a good lively errand
o&rsquo; mercy, and maybe see a circus too if there&rsquo;s any
there, and eat a dinner bought ready made. Seems
to me I should relish some vittles I hadn&rsquo;t cooked,
and to step off without washing the dishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Lauretta Ann,&rdquo; drawled Joshua, presently,
when Lammy, hugging Twinkle and telling him
the news, had gone upstairs to look at Bird&rsquo;s
paint-box, and sit in the dark and think of the
bliss of going to New York and surprising her
his very self, &ldquo;who do you calkerlate owns them
<em>six thousand dollars</em>?&rdquo; rolling the words about in
his mouth like a dainty morsel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, me,&mdash;that is we, of course!&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong in takin&rsquo; it?
Ah, Joshua, you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> think there&rsquo;s any wrong in
takin&rsquo; it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes and no, not that egzactly; but as the Squire
gave Lammy the law about things that&rsquo;s been
throwed out, it &rsquo;pears to me the find is hisn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it is, I&rsquo;m glad, and it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;
anyway. We can put the deed in Lammy&rsquo;s name,
and earn him good schoolin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; it along o&rsquo; little
Bird, for nobody knows how I&rsquo;ve missed that youngster
a runnin&rsquo; in and out these last months and feeling
her head on my shoulder times when she was
lonesome, and I mothered her in the rocker before
the fire. What with the high school, and the
painting school, and the female college over at
Northboro, there&rsquo;s all the eddication she&rsquo;ll need
for years close handy, and it&rsquo;s no wrong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
others, for there&rsquo;s this place for them to divide,
and they&rsquo;re strong and likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember the auction ain&rsquo;t took place yet,
Lauretta Ann, and don&rsquo;t set too sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joshua, the Lord has planned this out; it can&rsquo;t go
astray now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Joshua; &ldquo;but how about Old Lucky&rsquo;s
spell? and supposin&rsquo; Mr. Clarke takes a fancy to bid
on the fruit farm. I hear he&rsquo;s been for land hereabout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, I&rsquo;m <em>shocked</em> at you, and you nephew-in-law
to a deacon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane went upstairs to look for Lammy and
found him lying across his bed in an uneasy sleep,
with Twinkle keeping guard by him, while his
fatigue and the soaked boots in the corner told the
cause for the illness that was creeping over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pa,&rdquo; called Mrs. Lane down the backstairs, in
a husky whisper, &ldquo;do you go for Dr. Jedd without
waiting for the boys to come in. Lammy&rsquo;s chilled
and fevered and sweatin&rsquo; all to onct, and I can&rsquo;t
read nothing out of such crossway sinktoms. Dear
me suz, it does never rain but it pours! Say, Joshua,
you&rsquo;d best fetch that money up here to be put in the
iron maple-sugar pot afore you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time Dr. Jedd arrived Lammy was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
heavy sleep, from which he roused at the physician&rsquo;s
firm touch on his pulse, and began to talk
wildly.</p>

<p>At first he seemed to think that Dr. Jedd was
Old Lucky, for he cried, &ldquo;I gave you the silver
dollar and I made the bullets, but when I went to
shoot them, they turned into polliwogs and went
downstream.&rdquo; Then raising himself, he shook his
pillow violently, saying, &ldquo;You were a bad man to
tell me lies. How could I shoot the shadow of a
Christmas tree on a dark night? Cause when it&rsquo;s dark
there are&rsquo;nt any shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next he seemed to imagine that he was tramping
over the hills with the surveyors, and he had an
argument with himself, as to whether feet made
rods or rods feet, and then mumbled something
about <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> that they could not understand for they
did not know that one of his new friends had started
him in Algebra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is tired out,&rdquo; said Dr. Jedd, presently, &ldquo;and
in his mind more than his body. The professor
over at the camp told me that he had a great head
for mathematics, and was always asking questions
and working out sums and things on every scrap
of paper he came across, and that when paper gave
out he&rsquo;d smooth a place in the dirt and scratch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
away on that with a nail. Said that it was a pity
that he couldn&rsquo;t go to the Institute at Northboro
and be fitted for the School of Mines in New York.
Told me if he ever did, he could put him in the way
of free tuition at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pewter tea-pot! Take Bird out of the
pewter tea-pot; she&rsquo;s stuck in the spout, and when
you chop it off, it will kill her!&rdquo; shrieked Lammy,
jumping out of bed.</p>

<p>Dr. Jedd gave him some quieting medicine, and
he soon sank back among the pillows, with a burning
red spot of fever on each cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it typhoid?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Lane, her face white
and drawn; &ldquo;Janey died of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fever, but I cannot be quite sure of exactly
which one,&rdquo; said the doctor, opening a little case
he carried and taking out a fine needlelike instrument
and a bottle of alcohol. &ldquo;If I wait to
know until it develops, we shall be losing time;
if I prick his finger and send a drop of blood to
Dr. Devlin in Northboro, who makes a study of
such things, he will look at it through his microscope
and tell me in the morning exactly where we stand.&rdquo;
So after washing a spot clean with alcohol he took
the little red drop that tells so much to the really
wise physician and prevents all the mistakes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
guess-work, and then began to prepare some medicines
and write his directions for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any one you would like me to send up
to stay with you, Mrs. Lane?&rdquo; the doctor asked as
he prepared to leave. &ldquo;This may be a tedious
illness, and it won&rsquo;t do for you to wear yourself out
in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Byme-by, perhaps,&rdquo; Mrs. Lane replied &ldquo;but not
jest now while he talks so wild. You know, doctor,
how the best of folks will repeat and spy. Joshua
ain&rsquo;t overbusy, and he&rsquo;ll help me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that thing hanging round Lammy&rsquo;s
neck by a string under his shirt that he has such
a tight hold of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the key of the lower one of his chest of
drawers; he keeps odds and ends in it that he sets
store by, and I guess he&rsquo;s lost it so many times
that he&rsquo;s took to hanging it on safe by a string.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next afternoon when Dr. Jedd came, the
smile on his face reassured Mrs. Lane even before
he said: &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t typhoid&mdash;merely plain malaria,
and his worrying so much about Bird has made
him light-headed. What has become of the child?
Tired as she was in the spring, I would not answer
for her little wild-wood ladyship after a hot summer
in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mrs. Lane told sadly of the frequent invitations
and the unanswered letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to town for a little vacation after
the holidays, and I will look her up myself,&rdquo; said
the doctor, cheerily.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>It was many weeks after the night that Lammy
chopped up the pewter tea-pot and made his
wonderful discovery before the fever left him,
and then he felt so limp and weak that after sitting
up a few minutes he was glad to crawl into
bed again. His mind had only wandered during
the first two or three days, but frequently he
would wake up with a start from troubled sleep
and ask his mother anxiously if it was really true
about the tea-pot or only a dream. He was bitterly
disappointed when the night before the auction
came and the doctor told him that he must not
go, even though his big brother Nellis had offered
to put the great arm-chair in the cart and take
him down in that way, all wrapped in comfortables.
For the doctor said the excitement of thinking
of the matter was enough without being there.</p>

<p>On his way out, Dr. Jedd spent a few moments
before he went home, chatting to Joshua in the
kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow the tug of war is coming, Joshua,&rdquo;
said the doctor; &ldquo;all of your neighbours wish you
well and set great store by your wife, and we
hate to think of seeing strangers in the fruit farm.
If you can think up any way that we could accommodate
or help you out to buy it, why, just
speak out. If the two thousand dollars Miss
Jemima left my wife would make any difference
to you, she bid me say that, as she knows your
dread of mortgages, she would loan it on your
note of hand,&rdquo; at the same time holding out his
own toward Joshua as if it already held the
proffered money.</p>

<p>Joshua&rsquo;s honest face flushed with pleasure at the
implied trust, yet he could hardly keep the smile
from his lips and a mysterious twinkle from his
eyes as he shook the doctor&rsquo;s hand heartily and
answered: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re much obleeged, and we&rsquo;ll never
forget that you and Mis&rsquo;is Jedd held us well
enough in esteem to make the offer, but I reckon
the only way we could come to own the fruit farm
would be by buying it out fair and square. I
don&rsquo;t say but I&rsquo;d be downhearted to see it go by
me, especially to &rsquo;Biram Slocum, for they&rsquo;ve been
days, doc, when I&rsquo;ve even kind o&rsquo; pictured out
the two farms, ourn and it, joined fast by your sellin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
me that wood bluff that runs in between from the
highway. But you know the sayin&rsquo;, doc, &lsquo;Man
proposes, woman disposes,&rsquo; and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time the doctor caught the wink that Joshua&rsquo;s
near eye gave in spite of itself, but thought that it
referred to Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s peculiarities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, deliberately, a genial
smile spreading over his features, &ldquo;one thing I&rsquo;ll
do to help out your picturing, as you call it. If
luck should turn so that you buy the fruit farm,
I&rsquo;ll sell you the wood knoll for what I gave for
it, and that&rsquo;s the first time I ever considered parting
with it, though I&rsquo;ve had no end of good offers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the boys jest come home in time to
witness that there remark o&rsquo; yourn. Ain&rsquo;t yer
gettin&rsquo; kind er rash &rsquo;n&rsquo; hasty, doc?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Joshua, the more witnesses, the better,&rdquo;
and the two men went out the door, toward the
fence where the doctor&rsquo;s chaise was tied, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>As to the boys, they were completely bewildered,
for not a word did they know, or would until
after the auction, and they had not the remotest
idea that their father even dreamed of bidding on
the fruit farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII</a><br />

THE TUG OF WAR</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strain that Lammy had been under ever since
the reading of Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s will had told on him in
a way that only his mother understood, and after the
stubborn malarial fever itself was routed, he felt, as
he said, &ldquo;like the bones in my legs is willer
whistles,&rdquo; so Dinah Lucky was engaged to stay
with him on the morning of the long talked of auction
sale. He would have preferred some one else,
for Dinah was a great talker, and his head still felt
tired, but she was the only trustworthy person in the
entire neighbourhood who for either friendship or
money would consent to miss the auction.</p>

<p>According to the terms of the notice that had appeared
in the local papers and been posted in a ten-mile
circuit from Milltown to Northboro, the sale
conducted by Joel Hill, auctioneer, was to be held
on the fruit farm itself at ten o&rsquo;clock on the morning
of Thursday, December the ninth, &ldquo;by order of
Joshua Lane, Executor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>When the day came, it was bitterly cold, though
clear; a two-days old snow-storm followed by sleet
had crusted well, and the walking and sleighing were
both good, yet Joshua Lane was surprised when he
went down to the fruit farm at nine o&rsquo;clock in the
morning to sweep off the porch and light a fire in the
kitchen stove, which still remained on the premises
for cooking chickens&rsquo; food, to see many teams
already hitched to the fence, the horses well muffled
in blankets. People afoot were also going toward
the barn, where a Hungarian, who was retained to
tend the stock and act as watchman, had a room
and fire which, together with what information they
could extract from him, was what they sought.</p>

<p>As the man said, &ldquo;Yah! ha!&rdquo; equally loud to
every question, Joshua thought no harm could come
from that quarter, and proceeded to open the blinds
of the kitchen windows and make such preparations
as he could for protecting the audience from the cold.</p>

<p>By half-past nine the kitchen, sitting room, north
parlours, all bare of furniture, and the stairs were
packed with standing people, and when, at a few
minutes before ten, the auctioneer and the Northboro
lawyer, Mr. Cole, who had made Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
will, appeared together, they had to push their way
into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Slocum had been on hand early, of course,&mdash;she
always was,&mdash;and kept dropping mysterious
remarks and pursing up her lips. She began by
cheapening the entire place, saying the house was
not in as good repair as she had been led to think,
that the wall papers were frights, and that everything
needed paint, that four thousand dollars would
be a high price for the property, and she didn&rsquo;t know
who&rsquo;d buy it anyway. Then the next minute she was
requesting those about her not to crowd up the stairs,
as they might bend the hand rail, which would be just
so much out of the pocket of whoever bought the
house, adding that red Brussels carpet was her
choice for the north room.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, the two out-of-town Lane
brothers, Jason and Henry, were not there. The
&ldquo;all in due time&rdquo; policy that had always, and would
always, keep Henry poor, caused them to start for
the auction so late that the delay on the road caused
by a broken trace detained them until nearly eleven,
when they turned about and went home again so
as not to be late for dinner.</p>

<p>After reading the description of the property and
the cash terms of the sale, Joel Hill stood up on a
soap-box that he might overlook the assembly and
called out, &ldquo;What am I bid, to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>There was complete silence for a few moments.
Then the door opened, and Mr. Brotherton, one of
Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s agents from Northboro, entered, causing
a flutter of speculation as to what his presence might
mean and making Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s heart thump painfully.
Dr. Jedd and his wife, the minister and his
lady, together with Mrs. Lane, who were occupying
a bench that had been brought from the barn, and
were the only people seated, looked at the stove in
front of them, so that those who expected a bid from
that quarter were disappointed.</p>

<p>Joshua Lane, hands behind him, leaned against
the chimney front and gazed steadily at a wire that
held the stove-pipe in place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I bid, to start?&rdquo; repeated the auctioneer.
Abiram Slocum, scanning the various
groups with his ferret eyes, moved uneasily, moistened
his lips, and, as his wife gave him a prod with
her umbrella that exactly hit the &ldquo;funny bone&rdquo; of
his elbow, jerked out, &ldquo;Five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thousand,&rdquo; said a clear, distinct, but unfamiliar,
voice at the back of the room. There was
a unanimous turning of heads and twisting of bodies
toward the bidder, who proved to be Mr. Cole the
lawyer from Northboro, who made a very impressive
appearance, clad as he was in a handsome fur-lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
overcoat and a shiny silk hat. As he was also often
employed by Mr. Clarke, the mystery deepened.</p>

<p>Abiram Slocum gasped as if some one had poured
a pail of water over him at this unexpected competitor,
and then called, &ldquo;One thousand two
hundred and fifty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two thousand,&rdquo; from the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two thousand and fifty,&rdquo; shrieked Abiram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why waste time with small change a cold
morning like this?&rdquo; called the auctioneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three thousand,&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three thousand three hundred,&rdquo; snapped Abiram,
vainly endeavouring to get out of range of
the faces and gestures his wife was making at
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four thousand five hundred,&rdquo; jumped the lawyer,
beginning to button his coat and draw on his
gloves, as if the end were well in sight.</p>

<p>Abiram Slocum seemed bewildered, and glancing
at his wife, failed to read her signal aright, and resorted
to a hoarse whispering in the middle of
which she shook him off and shouted with an air of
triumph, &ldquo;Five thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane was seen to moisten her lips nervously,
and the colour in her cheeks deepened, but then
by this time the wood-stove was sending forth red-hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
air as only a sheet-iron stove working full
blast knows how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand two hundred and fifty,&rdquo; bid the
lawyer. Then followed an altercation between Mr.
and Mrs. Slocum. Vainly the auctioneer rapped;
they paid no attention, and upon the lawyer saying
that any further delay would cause a withdrawal
of his bid, the final &ldquo;Going, going, gone,
at five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars&rdquo; was
called, and it was not until fully twenty seconds after
the final bang of the hammer that the Slocums came
to, and Abiram fairly yelled, &ldquo;Six&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it was too late, and the fault was nobody&rsquo;s
but his own. He tried to protest and was
actually hissed down, Laurelville folk preferring to
see the property go anywhere so long as Mrs. Slocum
was not mistress of the fruit farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name of buyer?&rdquo; asked the auctioneer; &ldquo;self or
client?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Client,&rdquo; said the lawyer, slowly adjusting his
eyeglasses and glancing at a slip of paper, while
dead silence again prevailed, and the Slocums glared
forked lightning at each other and the world in
general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purchase is made by Lauretta Ann Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
as guardian for her son, Samuel Lane, and she is
prepared to deposit the price in cash, pending
searching of the title and transfer of deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shuffle as the people, released from
the strain, shifted from one numb foot to the
other, and then cheers broke out, for above curiosity
and all other feeling was one of joy that their
kind, hard-working neighbour had in some mysterious
way received what they firmly believed to be
her due.</p>

<p>When the applause had subsided and the general
handshaking ceased, Lauretta Ann Lane pulled
a large new wallet from some mysterious place in
her dress, and counting out eleven clean five-hundred-dollar
bills held them toward the auctioneer,
saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you for the change, please,&rdquo;
adding in a low yet perfectly distinct voice to an
irate figure who was elbowing her way out, and
meeting many obstacles in so doing, &ldquo;That change &rsquo;ll
come in right handy for new papers, paint, and
furnishings that you said was needful, and I think
a red Brussels carpet <em>would</em> liven up that north room
wonderful. That same was your choice, waren&rsquo;t
it, Mis&rsquo;is Slocum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>How it all came about the village never discovered;
for whatever the lawyer knew or <em>thought</em>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
kept it to himself and said the opposite, which is,
of course, what lawyers are for.</p>

<p>Dr. Jedd was the only one who suspected in the
right direction; for soon after the Lanes had
moved into their new home, and curiosity had
subsided, he was looking on the parlour mantel-shelf
for the matches, and discovered the chopped
remains of the pewter tea-pot reposing in a handsome
china jar that was bought in New York. But
Dr. Jedd only chuckled as the whole thing flashed
across him, and he said to himself, &ldquo;Surely enough,
man proposes and woman disposes, and there&rsquo;s a
various lot of human nature in woman, especially
Aunt Jimmy, who was a blessed, good, spunky, old
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One final sensation was given the neighbourhood
when it was found that, after the payment of the
legacies and other charges against the estate, there
was enough surplus to give the three Lane brothers
over three thousand dollars each, legal allotment.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a><br />

TELLTALE TROUSERS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Mrs. Lane was hurrying home from the auction,
that Lammy need not be kept in suspense a
moment longer than was necessary, she bumped
into Abiram Slocum, who was trudging moodily along
the road. His wife had left the house first, and
in her anger appropriated the cutter and gone
home, leaving him to walk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane intended to go by without speaking,
and merely gave a civil nod, but he would not allow
it; his ugly mood must find vent in words, and
as she passed he squared about, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no cause to feel so hoity toity if yer <em>hev</em>
got the fruit farm; <em>there&rsquo;s underhand business been
goin&rsquo; on here in Laurelville, if the light o&rsquo; truth was
let in</em>. Moreover, it&rsquo;s time that husband o&rsquo; yourn
as Minstrator of that Irish O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s debts should
pay me the rent due; the fact of the furniture
being burned don&rsquo;t release him a copper cent&rsquo;s
worth, as he well knows. Tell him from me he&rsquo;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
best come down and settle up; ter-morrow I reckon
to be at the tax office all forenoon, or&rdquo;&mdash;with an
evil sneer&mdash;&ldquo;mebbe, as you seem to hold the purse,
you&rsquo;d like to pay the debt out of charity to the girl
you bragged o&rsquo; being fond of, to save her the name
of pauper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane grew hot and cold by turns, and a
torrent of words rose to her lips, but the thought
of Lammy waiting so patiently checked her in time,
and she merely said, &ldquo;Yes, Abiram Slocum, you&rsquo;ll
hear from us to-morrer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she reached the home gate, she saw Dinah
Lucky, who was stationed at the window to give
the first word of her return, and at the same time
a wild-looking tawny head and a pair of big questioning
gray eyes appeared above her fat shoulder,
as Lammy steadied himself by the window-frame.
Quick as a flash she pulled off her red knitted shawl
and waved it joyfully, so that Lammy knew at least
two minutes before she could have reached his room
to tell him.</p>

<p>Once upstairs, she was obliged to begin at the
beginning and tell him the story of the morning
in every detail, holding his hand the while as if
to convince him that she was real and what she
told the plain truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Dinah slipped downstairs, saying she
would get the dinner and bring them both some
upstairs, for she was sure &ldquo;Missy Lane&rdquo; must be
clear tuckered out.</p>

<p>And so she was, though she had not realized it
until that moment and sinking back in the homemade
arm-chair, she closed her eyes in a state of
perfect peace, and must have dozed, for she awoke
with a start to hear Lammy say, &ldquo;This sort of
makes up for the Thanksgiving dinner I missed,&rdquo;
and there upon the various chairs and the bedstand
Dinah had spread a dinner tempting as only a
coloured &ldquo;born cook&rdquo; knows how to make it, while
the clashing of knives and forks below told her that
Joshua and the boys were provided for (they had
all staid at home from the shop to attend the auction)
and that this afternoon at least was her own.</p>

<p>After dinner Lammy lay for a long time, looking
at the wood fire flickering through the open front
of the stove, planning how they would fix Aunt
Jimmy&rsquo;s&mdash;or rather <em>his</em>&mdash;house, as his mother
called it, and when they would move. Of course,
Lammy wished to go at once&mdash;even a week seemed
a long delay. Mrs. Lane hesitated, for she had
thoughts of waiting until spring; yet, on the other
hand, she could not well leave the house empty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
travel up and down to tend the chickens. Aunt
Jimmy&rsquo;s house was by far the easier to heat, and
now as they must keep a hired man permanently,
he could be put into their present house and everything
settle down for a comfortable winter of work,
rest, and planning, so she said, much to Lammy&rsquo;s
joy, that she thought they could be in by Christmas
and then make the improvements at their leisure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can wait to paper the rooms&mdash;that is, all
except Bird&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have hers
fixed up for her when she comes, white and a paper
with wild roses&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she likes, and she made
a pattern for one once and was going to send it to
the wall-paper man when her father finished the
red piney pattern, only he never did.&rdquo; And Lammy
told his mother of Bird&rsquo;s hopes about her work, ending
by taking the string that held the key from about
his neck and saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please unlock my lower drawer and give me
Bird&rsquo;s bundle that her uncle would not let her
take with her; if I can&rsquo;t see her, I can look at her
things. I know she wouldn&rsquo;t mind, because I
went back in through the cellar with her that last
day and tied them up; only I didn&rsquo;t do it very
well because there was no good paper and string.
I&rsquo;d like to fix them better and put up the paint-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
by itself,&rdquo; he said, fumbling with the knots,
as his mother, much interested, took a fresh sheet
of paper from the press closet behind the bed.</p>

<p>As she reseated herself, the string broke, and the
contents of the hastily made bundle were scattered
about the bed. Lammy picked up the water-colour
drawings carefully, one by one, and smoothed them
out with the greatest care. There were a couple
of dozen of them, besides those of the wild roses
and the peony design, which Mrs. Lane at once
recognized from its spirit, even though it was
unfinished.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lammy cried out in delight, for there
before him was a pen-and-ink sketch of Bird herself,
much younger and happier than when he had
last seen her, but still his little friend to the life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he had feasted
his eyes on it, &ldquo;do you think there could be any
harm in putting this up on the mantel-shelf where
I could look at it&mdash;just for a few days until we
go to get Bird back?&rdquo; And of course his mother
assured him that there could be no possible harm.
Then, completely satisfied, he laid the sheets of
drawing-paper together again and prepared to make
them into a neat, flat package.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped this out,&rdquo; said his mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
reaching across the bed to pick up something that
had slid down between the coverlid and the wall,
and laid what seemed to be a letter in a long,
heavy, brown manila envelope tied with pink tape
in front of Lammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; he said, looking it
over; &ldquo;it must have been between the pictures
when we pulled them out of her father&rsquo;s box,
because those were all I saw when I made the
bundle up. See, there&rsquo;s writing on this side,&rdquo; and
holding it up to the light, for the winter twilight
was setting in, he read slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Papers concerning the Turner Mill Farm Property,&mdash;to
be recorded.&rsquo; I wonder what that means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s eyes fairly bulged, and great drops
of sweat stood on her forehead as she answered:
&ldquo;Means? It means, Lammy Lane, that the Lord
don&rsquo;t forget the orphan, and if Bird O&rsquo;More <em>is</em> in
New York, he&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo; after her business right
here in Laurelville.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill230"></a>
<img src="images/ill230.jpg" width="512" height="371" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>It means, Lammy Lane, that the Lord don&rsquo;t forget the orphan.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;The meaning of that letter is what Abiram
Slocum burnt up his cross-road house to conceal,
which he wouldn&rsquo;t hev done if it was of no
account.&rdquo; And Mrs. Lane poured out her suspicions
and ideas concerning the matter.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>At the supper-table that night Mrs. Lane repeated
Abiram Slocum&rsquo;s message to her husband, and he,
rubbing his chin with a troubled air, replied, &ldquo;Truth
be told, Lauretta Ann, owin&rsquo; to the burnin&rsquo; of
that furniture there isn&rsquo;t a cent left to pay that
claim, and I do hate to have poor O&rsquo;More held up
as an insolvent around here for sixty dollars, &rsquo;count o&rsquo;
Bird. He was a good-natured, harmless sort o&rsquo; feller,
enjoyin&rsquo; of himself as he went, very much like I&rsquo;d
be if you hadn&rsquo;t taken up with me, Mis&rsquo;is Lane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this compliment Mrs. Lane blushed like a girl
and murmured something about all men bein&rsquo; the
better for women&rsquo;s handling, provided it was the
right woman, which Mis&rsquo;is Slocum wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now as far as that sixty dollars goes, if it wasn&rsquo;t
owed to &rsquo;Biram Slocum, I&rsquo;d undertake ter pay it
myself, so as to get the receipt and settle everything
square up and clean billed, but, by jinks, it
sticks me to pay that low-down swindler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joshua Lane!&rdquo; cried his wife, in a tragic
tone, standing up and pointing her pudgy finger
at him with such a jerk that it made him start as
if it had been a bayonet, while she used the
most grandiloquent language she could muster:
&ldquo;The estate of the late lamented Terence O&rsquo;More
does not owe Abiram Slocum a bent penny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and as to the receipt for the same, I&rsquo;ll hand it to
you this time to-morrow night, leastwise if it doesn&rsquo;t
blow a blizzard &rsquo;twixt now and then, or Mis&rsquo;is Slocum
turn &rsquo;Biram into pickled peppers by the sight
of the face she wore home from the auction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, Lauretta Ann,&rdquo; wheedled Joshua,
&ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t minded of paying it, be ye? I&rsquo;d think
twice&mdash;that I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay!&rdquo; snorted Lauretta. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you
there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; owed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; actin&rsquo; enigmas and charades.
Not thet it&rsquo;s anything new, but if I was you, I&rsquo;d be
mighty keerful how I baited &rsquo;Biram Slocum; he is
too cute for most men, and he would take to the law
for a heedless word jest now, he&rsquo;s that riled about
the wardrobe story leakin&rsquo; out and losing the fruit
farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, and don&rsquo;t you fret, Joshua; if
there is any law called in, it&rsquo;ll be by me.&rdquo; And pump
and quiz as he might, not another word could he
extract from his wife upon the subject.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Early the next morning Mrs. Lane harnessed
the &ldquo;colt,&rdquo; which, though ten years old, still bore
his youthful name, to the cutter, and after putting
her egg-basket deep under the robe and depositing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
her satchel on top of it, turned up the hill road
toward Northboro, waving her whip good-by to
Lammy, who, seated in the big chair in his window,
smiled at her, with his finger pressed to his lips, as
if cautioning silence.</p>

<p>As the sleigh bells jingled and the &ldquo;colt&rdquo; loped
easily along, Mrs. Lane leaned back as if the motion
and jolly sound expressed her own feelings admirably,
and the miles flew swiftly by.</p>

<p>When Northboro was reached, she drove to the
stable where she always left her horse in unseasonable
weather, but instead of carrying the familiar
egg-basket into town, she stowed it away under
the sleigh seat, and hanging her satchel securely
on her arm, drew on her best gloves that she had
brought in her pocket, and started up the main
street at a vigorous trot. Coming to a gray stone
building next the court-house, where many lawyers
had offices, she read the various signs anxiously,
and then spying that of Mr. Cole, opened the
swinging outside door and climbed the two flights
of stairs that led to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole greeted her pleasantly, for he had a very
kindly feeling toward this generous-hearted woman;
but when he heard her story and saw the legal-looking
envelope, he became doubly interested. Untying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the tape, he read the various papers through, one
after the other, while Mrs. Lane watched his eagerness
with evident satisfaction. When he had finished,
he replaced the papers and tied them up deliberately
before he said: &ldquo;These papers appear to me
to be of great importance to O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s daughter,
though exactly what they amount to I cannot tell
until I see the dates of certain mortgages and transfers
on record in Milltown. Fortunately the attorney,
Mr. King, who drew up the papers before he went
to California four years ago, has returned on a visit,
and I am to meet him in court this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Bird hasn&rsquo;t anything to
pay what Joshua says they call the retainment fee,
but if a little money &rsquo;ll help her get her rights, you
may hold me good for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not be necessary,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
smiling, &ldquo;for my client, Mr. Clarke, is as anxious to
have the title to the Mill Farm cleared as you are, so
in serving him I may be able to aid Bird. Slocum,
the present owner, seems a slippery man at best.
You know that the insurance company, for which I
also happen to be the agent, withholds his claim
because he gave the date of June 9 for his fire when
it took place the 10th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s eyes grew steelly bright, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
she moistened her lips nervously. Then Mr. Cole
put the papers in his safe and closed the door with
its mysterious lock, and Mrs. Lane breathed a sigh of
relief and, asking him to write as soon as he had
news, either good or bad, went carefully down the
shallow marble stairs of the office building, for
elevators she would have none of.</p>

<p>Once more in the street, she spied a bakery and,
going in, ordered a cup of coffee and half a custard
pie, which she ate with relish and then returned to
the stable for the &ldquo;colt&rdquo; without doing any of her
usual market-day trading.</p>

<p>It was only half-past eleven when Mrs. Lane,
coming down the hill road, saw Laurelville lying
before her in the valley, and five minutes later when
she hitched the colt in front of the town-house,
throwing the coon lap-robe over him in addition to
his blanket.</p>

<p>The selectmen had been in consultation, and were
now standing outside, making holes in the snow with
their boot toes and finding it difficult to break away,
after the usual manner of rural communities. Mrs.
Lane nodded pleasantly and asked if every one else
had gone home to dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mostly,&rdquo; replied First Selectman Penfield, &ldquo;but
Judge Ricker&rsquo;s in his office, I reckon, and Slocum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he&rsquo;s in the end room as &rsquo;cessor, waitin&rsquo; for folks to
swear their taxes, for which they appear to be in no
hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was exactly the information Mrs. Lane wanted,
and she walked directly down the corridor, this time
firmly grasping the egg-basket and leaving the satchel
outside.</p>

<p>Opening the door without knocking, she had entered,
closed it, and seated herself opposite Abiram
Slocum before he was aware of her presence, and do
what he could, he was not able to control the slight
start that her appearance gave him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning, marm,&rdquo; he said formally, putting his
thumbs in the armholes of his vest and puffing out
his cheeks with importance; &ldquo;want to swear your
taxes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day; Joshua always attends to that. I&rsquo;ve
jest dropped in ter get that receipt for the O&rsquo;More
rent, as Joshua intends settling the matter up with
Judge Ricker this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very glad to hear it, Mrs. Joshua Lane; it saves
me lots of trouble, and I hate to go to law unless required.&rdquo;
And he drew a blank form from a desk,
which he filled in, signed, and was about to hand
across the table, when he suddenly withdrew it,
saying, &ldquo;Well, where are the sixty dollars?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They was paid you June the 10th.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted Abiram, really believing the
woman to be crazy, and retreating behind the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so; by that I mean all that good furniture
you set fire to along with your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slocum turned ghastly white and almost staggered,
but quickly recovering himself, he sprang
forward furiously, and for a moment Mrs. Lane
thought he was going to strike her, but glancing
out the window she saw that Selectman Penfield
was below, and this reassured her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for slander as sure as my
name&rsquo;s Abiram Slocum,&rdquo; he gasped, trying to get out
the door in front of which she stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hasty; if you wait, you will hear
more to get up that slander claim on, mostlike. Jest
you go back and set down while I have my say, and
if you want witnesses to it, Judge Ricker will step in,
I&rsquo;m sure, or Mr. Penfield either; they are both real
handy. As you said yesterday, <em>there&rsquo;s underhand
business been goin&rsquo; on in town if the light o&rsquo; truth
could be let in</em>, which I&rsquo;m now doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Abiram hesitated, and sank back into the
chair, casting an uneasy look at his visitor, who proceeded
to state her case both rapidly and clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Friday, the 10th of June, you fired that
house, though you did give into the insurance company
&rsquo;twas the 9th.&rdquo; (Here again Slocum jumped,
and his hands worked nervously.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 10th was circus day, and most all the
town had gone to Northboro. Likewise Lockwood&rsquo;s
field-hands went, and so there were no men folks
working up beyond four corners; this gave you a
clear coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You started for the circus with Mis&rsquo;is Slocum
and &rsquo;Ram; you turned back, giving it out you&rsquo;d got
important business at the Mill Farm. But you didn&rsquo;t
go, and turned up before noon at the turnpike
store, where you never trade. There you bought a
new gallon can of kerosene, saying you was going
up to the north lots to make a wash of it fer tent-worms
in the apple trees. Now there ain&rsquo;t even a
wild crab tree in the north lots&mdash;only corn-fields.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went up that way all right, and a-spookin&rsquo;
around the house. Everything was tight fast, and so
the only place you could get in was by crawlin&rsquo;
through the cellar winder, which you did, tearin&rsquo; a
new pair o&rsquo; herrin&rsquo;-bone pattern trousers so doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Slocum started, and his face wore a look of
intense wonder mixed with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you looked about for what you didn&rsquo;t find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
you spilled the kerosene about and set fire so&rsquo;s nobody
could get what maybe you&rsquo;d overlooked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you scooted back in the corn lot and hid the
can in the big blasted chestnut stump, and when a
hue and cry was raised walked down as innercent
as May, from hoein&rsquo; corn that wasn&rsquo;t yet above
ground!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Slocum had pulled himself together,
and his defiance returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman, you are crazy, and what you say is perfectully
redeclous; I&rsquo;ll have you behind asylum bars,
if not in jail. Mere talk! You can&rsquo;t prove a word
you say, and what is this &rsquo;thing&rsquo; that I couldn&rsquo;t find
and wanted to burn? Just tell me that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prove? Oh, yes, I can; Lauretta Ann Lane
is no random talker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the pants you wore, and that you sold the
pedler the same afternoon&mdash;they smell yet o&rsquo; kerosene,
and here&rsquo;s the piece ye tore out on the winder-catch!&rdquo;
And Mrs. Lane whipped the telltale trousers
out of her egg-basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kerosene can&rsquo;s in the stump yet, but I&rsquo;ve got
it all straight; that poor Polack woman you turned
out of house and home seen you hide it. Now what
else was there?&rdquo; And Mrs. Lane affected a lapse of
memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you wanted to know what you was
a-lookin&rsquo; for. Why, don&rsquo;t you know? It was a big
lawyer&rsquo;s envelope marked &lsquo;Papers concerning the
Turner Mill Farm Property,&mdash;to be recorded.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slocum breathed hard and grasped the table edge
to steady himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest why you wanted them papers I don&rsquo;t know,
but Lawyer Cole in Northboro, who&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em, is
goin&rsquo; to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawyer Cole has them?&rdquo; Slocum whispered
hoarsely; &ldquo;Lawyer Cole, did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Lane; &ldquo;and if you
don&rsquo;t think the testimony I&rsquo;ve been givin&rsquo; you is true,
and consider it a slander, I&rsquo;ve got it writ out, and I&rsquo;ll
have him search that out too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Slocum, speaking as if to himself.
&ldquo;How did you ever find&mdash;&rdquo; and then he remembered
and stopped. Mrs. Lane waited a few minutes, and
then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s full noon now, and I must get home to dinner,
so I&rsquo;ll trouble you for that rent receipt. Thanks, and
I&rsquo;ll give you a word of advice in return. The Lord
mostly finds out evil-doers, and not infrequent He
trusts women to help Him, and I want you to consider
that if I don&rsquo;t give this matter a public airin&rsquo;, it isn&rsquo;t
from either pity or fear of you, but because I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
want the county to know that we harboured such a
skunk among us so long; my last word being that
you&rsquo;d better get away from my neighbourhood before
I change my mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it came about that before Christmas Abiram
Slocum gave it out that his wife&rsquo;s health was poor and
he had been advised to go to California, where he
intended to buy a vineyard, hinting at the same time
that as he expected to sell a large tract of land to
Mr. Clarke, he had no further interest in Laurelville;
and though only four people knew the real reason,
the whole village rejoiced without the slightest effort
at concealment.</p>

<p>At the same time Joshua Lane found that his work
as administrator of the O&rsquo;More property had only
begun instead of being closed.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a><br />

THE FIRE-ESCAPE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> had Bird O&rsquo;More been doing these many
days? It did not need the skill of a magician to
tell why even her notes to her Laurelville friends
had been brief at best and then finally ceased. A
single peep at her surroundings would have told the
tale, and the more completely she became merged
in them, the more hopeless she felt them to be.</p>

<p>Her weekly work in distributing the flowers was
a bright spot indeed, as well as her visits to
Tessie; but as she looked forward to the time
when frost would kill the blossoms, the Flower
Mission be closed, and the liberty of streets and
parks cut off for confinement in the dark flat, her
heart sank indeed.</p>

<p>All her hopes were centred about going to
school, and the possibilities of meeting teachers
who would understand her desire to learn, and
help her with sympathy. Meanwhile, the city
summer had told upon her country-bred body even
more than on her sensitive temperament, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
grew thinner every day, until finally her aunt was
compelled to see it in spite of herself, and promised
to take her down to Coney Island or Rockaway
Beach &ldquo;some day&rdquo; when she was not busy,
to freshen her up a bit; but that day never came,
and as little Billy was constantly improving, her
uncle had eyes only for him. In fact, the change
in the little cripple was little short of marvellous.
Of course his lameness remained, but his cheeks
were round, his lips had lost their blue tint, and
to hear him cry or complain was a rare sound
indeed. That all this came of Bird&rsquo;s devoted care
her uncle was quite convinced; for it was she who
gave Billy his morning bath, and managed,&mdash;no easy
task,&mdash;that the battered tub should not again be used
for a cupboard. It was Bird who took his food
into the fire-escape bower, and coaxed and tempted
him until he had eaten sufficient, and it was she
who put him nightly into the little bed opposite
her own and taught him to say, as a little prayer,
the verse of the hymn her own mother had sung to
her in the misty long ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Jesus, gentle Shepherd, hear me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless thy little lamb to-night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the darkness be thou near me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep me safe till morning light.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>But for Billy, Bird could not have endured through
that dreadful summer. As it was, she often fingered
her &ldquo;keepsake,&rdquo; still hanging about her neck, the
thought comforting her that with the mysterious
coin in it she could get back once more to the
little village that seemed like heaven to her, no
matter what happened after. Often, in fact, the
only thing that kept her from running away was
the belief that if her good friends could take her
permanently, they would have sent for her, and
pride, heroic pride, born of Old and New England,
was still strong in Ladybird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll perk up when school begins and she gets
acquainted with girls her own age,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;More,
cheerfully, as his attention was called to her pale
cheeks by his wife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m owin&rsquo; her good will for
what she&rsquo;s done for Billy, else I most wish I&rsquo;d left
her up there with those hayseeds that wanted her.
Somehow she don&rsquo;t fit in here, for all that she
never complains. She&rsquo;s different from us, and she
makes me uncomfortable, lookin&rsquo; so solemn at me
if I chance to take off my coat and collar of a
night at supper to ease up a bit. Terence was
different from us, too, and it&rsquo;s bred in the bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let well enough alone,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;More,
glad to have Billy so completely taken off her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hands; &ldquo;folks can&rsquo;t afford to be different to their
own, unless they&rsquo;ve got the price. I&rsquo;ve made her
a good dress out of a remnant of bright plaid I
bought, so next week she can shell off them shabby
black duds that give me the shivers every time I
see them. Maybe fixin&rsquo; up like other girls &rsquo;ll bring
her to and liven her. She&rsquo;s queer though, sure
enough, don&rsquo;t give no sass, and it ain&rsquo;t natural; I
never seen a girl her age before that didn&rsquo;t talk
back, and sometimes it riles me to see her keep
so close shet when I up and let fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In September school began, but this brought
further disappointment, for Bird had hoped to find
a friend at least in the teacher. She was, however,
graded according to her size and age, not ability,
as if she had been a wooden box, and found herself
in an overcrowded room, a weak-eyed little Italian,
with brass earrings, seated on one side of her, and
the Polish sausage-seller&rsquo;s daughter on the other,
her dirty hands heavy with glass rings, which caused
her to keep whispering behind Bird&rsquo;s back as to her
lack of jewellery and style; while at the first recess
this little Slav told the astonished Bird, &ldquo;If yer
tink to get in vid us, you&rsquo;ll got to pomp you &rsquo;air;
dis crowt, we&rsquo;s stylish barticular&mdash;ve iss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the teacher in trim shirt-waist, with pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
hands and hair, to whom the class recited in chorus,
Bird longed to speak to her, to touch her, but she
fled to a purer atmosphere as soon as school was
out, and was remote as the stars.</p>

<p>As the weather grew cool, the fire-escape arbour
was abandoned; they could spend less time out of
doors, and Bird felt caged indeed. The engine-house
now was the limit of their walks, for it grew
dark very soon after school was out. Still they
never tired of seeing the horses dash out, and Billy
called Big Dave &ldquo;my fireman,&rdquo; and used to shout
to him as he passed in the street. So the autumn
passed.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>It was a clear, cold afternoon a little before Christmas;
the shops were gay with pretty things, and
the streets with people. Billy was in a fever of
excitement because his father, who had left home
on a business trip a few days before, had promised
him a Christmas tree, and Bird had gone out to buy
the candles and some little toys to put on it, at a
street stall. Billy, however, did not go, for he was
not to see the toys until Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Bird wandered across to Broadway at 23rd Street,
and then followed the stream of shoppers southward.
Was it only a year since last Christmas when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
had helped trim the tree at Sunday-school in Laurelville
and had sung the treble-solo part in&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Watchman! tell us of the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the signs of promise are.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Would there ever again be any signs of promise
for her? Somehow she had never before felt
so lonely for her father as in that merry crowd.
She wondered if he saw and was disappointed in
her, and what Lammy was doing. Going up on
the hill probably with the other village children to
cut the Christmas tree and greens for church.</p>

<p>Not minding where she went, she followed the
crowd on past and around Union Square and down
town again. Then realizing that she was facing
away from home and had not bought her candles,
she looked up and saw on the opposite side of the
street a beautiful gray stone church. At one side
and joined to it was what looked like a house set
well back from the street, from which it was separated
by a wide garden. People were going in and
out of the church by twos and threes.</p>

<p>A voice seemed to call Bird, and she too crossed
Broadway and timidly pushed open the swinging door.</p>

<p>At first she could see nothing, as the only lights
in the church were near the chancel. Then different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
objects began to outline themselves. There
was no service going on, the people having come
in merely for a few quiet moments.</p>

<p>Bird stood quite still in the little open space by
a side door back of the pews; it was the first really
peaceful time she had known since the day that
she and Lammy carried the red peonies to the
hillside graveyard, and as she thought of it, she
seemed to smell the sweet spruce fragrance of those
runaway Christmas trees that watched where her
parents slept.</p>

<p>A flock of little choir boys trooped in from an
opposite door for the final practice of their Christmas
carols and grouped themselves in the stalls.
Next a quiver of sound rushed through the church
as the great organ drew its breath and swelled its
lungs, as if humming the melody before breaking
into voice. Then above its tones rang a clear boy-soprano.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Watchman! tell us of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the signs of promise are.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">and the chorus answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Traveller! o&rsquo;er yon mountain height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that glory-beaming star.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The answering echo quivered in Bird&rsquo;s throat,
suffocating her, and as, unable to stand, she knelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
trembling upon the floor the odour of spruce again
enveloped her, and groping, she found that she was
really leaning against a pile of small trees that
had been brought there to decorate the church for
Christmas Eve, and as the door opened, men came
in bringing more&mdash;dozens and dozens of them, it
seemed.</p>

<p>Bird picked up a broken twig, and in spite of its
sharpness pressed it against her face, kissing it
passionately, never noticing that she was directly in
the passage between the door and aisle, where
presently a gentleman coming hurriedly in stumbled
over her.</p>

<p>He was about to pass on with a curt apology,
but glancing down, he saw that it was a little girl, and
that though comfortably dressed and not actually
poor, her face showed signs of distress and tears,
so he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, my child?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you
lost your way, or what? Come here and sit in this
pew while you tell me about it. I&rsquo;ve a daughter at
home only a couple of years older than you, and
she doesn&rsquo;t like to have any one sad at Christmas
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was months since any one had spoken to Bird
in the gentle tongue that had been her father&rsquo;s and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was her own, and though the tears started anew, she
made haste to obey, lest he should suddenly disappear
like all her pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>He was an alert, middle-aged man of affairs. He
had a fine presence and keen eyes and, without making
her feel that he was prying, succeeded in
drawing out the bare facts of her story, nothing
more, so that he had no idea that the trouble was
more than a country-bred child&rsquo;s homesickness at
being shut up in the city, and having to go to school
instead of reading all day long and trying to paint
flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you used to live in Laurelville?&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;why, I have a country place near there, not far
from Northboro, my native town, where I built an
Art School, and I have little city girls come to us
there every summer for a playtime. If you will
remember and write, or come to me when the next
summer vacation begins, you shall be one of them.
Meanwhile keep this, my address.&rdquo; He handed her a
card and passed on, for he was a good man and rich,
with many people to make happy at Christmas time,
and to be both rich and good in New York one must
work very hard indeed.</p>

<p>Going out into the street again, Bird read the
name on the card before slipping it into her pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Wonder of wonders! it was Clarke, the same as that
of the wall-paper manufacturer whose manager had
asked Terry to make designs for him. Of course
he must be Marion Clarke&rsquo;s father. The address
was different from the one of the factory, but Bird
knew enough of the city now to guess that this
number on the card was of his house, and she
now remembered that people had said that he conducted
many various manufactories.</p>

<p>So he had built the School of Design at Northboro
that she had dreamed about ever since she
went there with her father to look at an exhibition
of drawings! Could it be that this card was the
Christmas sign of hope and promise to her? She
almost flew homeward after buying the candles and
little toys, and laughed and chatted so cheerfully
with Billy when she gave him his supper, that her
cousin Larry, who had always teased her for being
set up, remarked to his mother, &ldquo;Ladybird is coming
down from her perch some; maybe she&rsquo;ll get to
be like us, after all.&rdquo; But it was upward, not downward,
that the brave, clipped wings were struggling.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>Between Christmas and New Year there came a
snow-storm, and then bitterly cold weather. In
Laurelville snow meant sleighing, coasting, bracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
air, and rosy cheeks; in East 24th Street it signified
soaked skirts, sodden shoes, and sore throats, while
for Billy it brought unhappy shut-in days, for his
crutch slipped dangerously in icy weather.</p>

<p>One evening Mrs. O&rsquo;More was called out to sit
with a sick neighbour. She told Bird not to wait up
as she might be late, and she would take the key
with her, as the boys had keys of their own if they
came in first.</p>

<p>Bird was used to thus staying shut into the flat
alone, and so after she heard the key turn in the
door of their narrow hallway, she amused herself for
perhaps an hour by drawing, and then went to bed.
She had been dragging Billy about on his sled up
and down the street all the afternoon, so she soon
fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>It must have been a couple of hours after when
she waked up suddenly and tried vainly to think
where she was. The room felt hot and airless, and a
strange smell of scorched leather filled the air. She
managed to get on her feet, pulled on a few clothes,
and tried to open a side window, but it stuck fast.
Going to the front, she raised the sash, and as she did
so, a cloud of smoke poured into the room, while the
shouts and clashing of gongs in the street told what
it was that had wakened her&mdash;the fire-engines! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
great sales stables with their tons of hay and straw
were on fire, and the house also, while in the street
all was in an uproar of frightened horses and men.</p>

<p>Rushing back to her room, she shook Billy awake
and, wrapping a few clothes about him, dragged him
toward the hall door. It was locked of course, as
Mrs. O&rsquo;More had taken the key. By this time the
smoke and flames were pouring in the front windows.
Ah, the fire-escape! Through the kitchen she struggled,
and out on to the icy balcony, having the sense
to close the window behind her.</p>

<p>The back yards were full of firemen, and excited
people hung from the windows of opposite buildings.
Bird tried to raise the trap in the floor door, but the
boxes of frozen earth that had held the morning-glories
bore it down, making it useless, and the one
below was hopelessly heaped with litter.</p>

<p>Would nobody see her? Billy clung to her, sobbing
pitifully, for he was lightly covered, and shivered
with cold as well as fear. The window-frame
inside was catching, and heat also came up from
below. Was this the end? Must the wild bird die
in her cage?</p>

<p>Suddenly a great shout arose in the rear; people
had seen and were pointing them out. Up came the
firemen, climbing, clinging, battering down the obstructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
before them. Ah, those wonderful firemen that
keep our faith in old-time valour!</p>

<p>A moment more, and an axe struck open the prisoned
trap-door, a head came through, and a voice
cried, &ldquo;Good God, it&rsquo;s Bird and little Billy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dave, my fireman!&rdquo; sobbed the boy, flinging himself
into the strong arms. &ldquo;Take him,&rdquo; commanded
Bird, as the man hesitated an instant; &ldquo;I can follow.&rdquo;
Down the ladder they went step by step until the
flames from the lower story crept through and
stopped them again, and the slender fire ladder, held
by strong arms, shot up to them, and Dave&rsquo;s mate
grasped Bird and carried her down to safety. Then
the firemen cheered, and tears rolled down Big Dave&rsquo;s
cheeks unchecked.</p>

<p>Kind, if rough, people took them in and warmed
and fed them, and more kind people guided Mrs.
O&rsquo;More to them when she rushed frantically home.
But little Billy had suffered a nervous shock, and lay
there moaning and seeming to think that the fire still
pursued him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will need great care and nursing to pull
him through, for he is naturally delicate,&rdquo; said the
doctor the next day when they had moved into a
couple of furnished rooms that were rented to Mrs.
O&rsquo;More by a friend in a near-by street until she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
could pull herself together, as they had lost everything.
&ldquo;He must either go to a hospital or have
a nurse,&rdquo; continued the doctor, gravely. But Mrs.
O&rsquo;More could not be made to see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His father&rsquo;d never forgive me if I put him
out o&rsquo; me hands,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll pick up from
the fright after a bit, and what with John away,
and never saving a cent of cash no more than the boys,
and the business all burned out along with us, I&rsquo;ve
not money in hand for the wasting on nurses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bird knew better,&mdash;knew that Billy was very
sick, and she could not let him die so. Ah! the
keepsake, the precious coin! Now was the time to
spend it, for there could be no greater necessity
than this. What if it was not enough? Even if
it was not much, it might do until her uncle got
back, and then she knew Billy would have care if
his father begged in the street for it.</p>

<p>Going away in a corner, she unfastened the silver
chain and detached the little bag from it. With
difficulty she ripped the thong stitches, but instead
of a coin, out of many wrappings fell a slender
band of gold set with one large diamond. As she
turned the ring over in surprise, some letters within
caught her eye&mdash;&ldquo;Bertha Rawley, from her godfather,
J.&nbsp;S.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the name of Terence O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s mother,
and the ring had been a wedding gift from her
godfather, and the one valuable possession that she
had clung to all her troubled life. But Bird knew
nothing of this.</p>

<p>What could Bird do with it? She pondered&mdash;her
city life had made her shrewd; she knew the
miseries of the poor who went to the pawn shops,
and guessed that any one in the neighbourhood
might undervalue the ring, or likely enough say
that she stole it.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarke&mdash;she would go to him! Now was the
time! She borrowed a hat and wrap from the
woman of whom the rooms were rented and stole
out. In an hour she came back with a triumphant
look upon her face, and laying a roll of bills before
her aunt, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sold my keepsake; now we
will have a nurse for Billy right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she understood about the money, and
found that it was one hundred dollars, Mrs. O&rsquo;More
broke down and cried like a baby, telling Bird that
she was a real lady and no mistake. And then
adding, to Bird&rsquo;s indignation, &ldquo;I wonder did you
get the value o&rsquo; the ring, or did he cheat you, the
old skin!&rdquo; But, nevertheless, the nurse came, and
not an hour too soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile a certain rich man sat at his library
desk, holding a diamond ring in his hand, saying,
half aloud: &ldquo;I believe the girl&rsquo;s story, though I suppose
most people would say she stole the ring, or
was given it by those who did. It is healthier to
believe than to doubt. I shall investigate the matter
to-morrow and keep the ring for the child. It is
a fine stone worth four times the sum I gave her,
but she would not take any more than the one
hundred dollars, nor was it wise for me to press
her. Ah! letters inside! Bertha Rawley! She
said her grandmother was an Englishwoman. That
new superintendent of the Northboro Art School
is named Rawley. He studied at South Kensington.
I wonder if they could be related. O&rsquo;More. I
think that name comes into that Mill Farm deed
mix-up. I will write to Rawley at once and see
what is known about the girl in Laurelville, for
something tells me that child is &lsquo;one of these little
ones&rsquo; who should be helped.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV</a><br />

THE BIRD IS FREED</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">January</span> was half over before it was possible for
the Lanes to take their long-promised trip to New
York to look up Bird and bring her back, as her
uncle had exacted, a legal sister to Lammy.</p>

<p>Moving from the small house into the large one,
even though the necessary repairs were to be made
by degrees, was more of an undertaking than Mrs.
Lane had bargained for. Also it took Lammy a
long time to get &ldquo;the bones back in his legs,&rdquo; though
happiness and Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s tonics worked wonders.</p>

<p>Dr. Jedd had suggested that a furnace required
much less care than three or four stoves, and so
one had been put in. Mrs. Jedd, who had very
good taste, and a tactful way of expressing it that
never gave offence, suggested to Mrs. Lane that,
instead of covering the mahogany parlour set with
red plush, the floor with a red-figured tapestry
brussels, replacing the small window-panes with
great sheets of glass, bricking up the wide fireplace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and then closing the whole room up except,
as Joshua said, for funerals, it should be turned
into a comfortable living-room.</p>

<p>This suited Joshua, the older boys, and Lammy
exactly, and though Lauretta Ann demurred at
first, saying, &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem hardly respectable not
to hev a best room,&rdquo; she quickly yielded, and said
that it &ldquo;would be a real comfort to have a separate
place to eat in when there was a lot of baking
on hand and the kitchen all of a tousle,
likewise to set in after meals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old furniture was recovered with a suitable
dull green corduroy, and some comfortable Morris
chairs added, &ldquo;that pa and the boys wouldn&rsquo;t be
tempted to set back on the hind legs of the mahogany,
which is brittle.&rdquo; A deep red rug, that
would not have to be untacked at housecleaning
times, covered the centre of the floor, with Grandmother
Lane&rsquo;s long Thanksgiving dinner-table in the
centre, and a smaller round one with folding leaves
in the corner, for the entertaining of the friends who
were constantly dropping in for a chat and a cup
of tea and crullers or a cut of mince pie, for no
one in the county had such a reputation for crullers
and mince meat, combined with a lavish use of them,
as Lauretta Ann Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Mrs. Jedd ventured to suggest that the
fireplace be left open and some of the big logs,
with which Aunt Jimmy had always kept the
woodshed filled, simply because her mother had
done so before her, used for a nightly hearth fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane said she hadn&rsquo;t any andirons and the
ashes would make dust, but Joshua was so pleased
with the idea of returning to old ways that she
yielded; and when, on the old fire-board being
removed to clean the chimney of soot and swallows&rsquo;
nests, a pair of tall andirons and a fender were
found, the matter settled itself, and Mrs. Lane soon
came to take pride in the cheerful blaze, while the
best dishes, which were of really handsome blue
and white India porcelain, were ranged in racks
over the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>Then there was a sunny southwest window, and
Joshua fastened a long shelf in front of this for
his wife&rsquo;s geraniums, wax-plant, and wandering
Jew that had shut out the light from the best
window in the kitchen, and these brought in the
welcome touch of greenery in spite of the particoloured
crimped paper with which she insisted
upon decorating the pots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How Bird will love this room!&rdquo; Lammy said
a dozen times a day, as he remembered how prettily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
she had arranged the scanty furnishings at the
house above the crossroads, and disliked everything
that savoured of show or cheap finery, and
it seemed to him that Bird&rsquo;s companionship was
the only thing necessary to prove that heaven,
instead of being a far-away region, at least had a
branch at the fruit farm in Laurelville.</p>

<p>The doctor said that Lammy must not return to
school until the midwinter term, and so he spent
his time in the shop back of the barn, making
many little knickknacks for the house, not a few
of them being intended for Bird&rsquo;s room, for which
he also designed a low book-shelf that made a
seat in the dormer window, and a table with a hinge
that she could use when she wished to draw or paint,
and then close against the wall.</p>

<p>This room was next to Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s, and had two
dormer windows and a deep press closet lighted by
a high window, under which the washstand stood.
It was furnished with a white enamelled bed and a
plain white painted dresser, upon which, Lammy
said, Bird could paint whatever flowers she chose.
There were frilled curtains of striped dimity at
the windows, and a quilt and bed valance of the
same, for Mrs. Lane despised any ornamental
fabric that would not wash and &ldquo;bile.&rdquo; The floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was covered with matting, but three sheepskin
rugs of home raising and dyed fox colour were
placed, one at the side of the bed, one before
the bureau, and one under the wall table, upon
which Bird&rsquo;s paint-box stood close to the leather-paper
portfolio that Lammy had made to hold the
precious sketches.</p>

<p>He had tried his best to find a wall paper with
a red &ldquo;piney&rdquo; border, but they told him at the
great paper warehouse at Northboro that they had
never seen such a paper, so he took wild-rose sprays
instead.</p>

<p>Lammy had also filled a small bark-covered box
with Christmas ferns, ebony spleenwort, wintergreen,
partridge-berries, and moss, for the window-ledge,
while fresh festoons of ground-pine topped the
windows even though Christmas was long past. In
fact, Lammy could hardly keep away from the room,
and often when he went in, he met his mother, for
whom it had the same attraction, and then they
would both laugh happily and, closing the door,
come away hand in hand.</p>

<p>It never occurred to a single member of this
simple, warm-hearted family, that there was any
possibility of there being a slip between cup and
lip, and in this faith they presently set out upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
their pilgrimage to New York, for which event
Lammy wore a high collar and a new suit, his
first to have long trousers.</p>

<p>The minister&rsquo;s wife and Dinah Lucky took joint
charge of the house while the Lanes were in
New York, for they intended staying several days,
perhaps a week, as Dr. Jedd said the change
was exactly what they all needed after the doings
and anxieties of the past eight months, and Mr.
Cole, the lawyer from Northboro, gave them the
card of a good hotel close to the Grand Central
Station, where they would be well treated and
neither snubbed nor overcharged. For he well
knew that in a New York hotel, Laurelville&rsquo;s Sunday-best
clothes looked as strangely out of place
as Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s carryall would on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>During the past few weeks, Alfred Rawley, the
new superintendent of the Northboro School of
Industrial Art, had made several visits to the Lanes,
at first upon business connected with Aunt Jimmy&rsquo;s
legacy, and then because he seemed to like to come.
He was a fine-looking man of fifty, and not only a
stranger in Northboro, but a bachelor without home
ties. He seemed greatly interested in Bird, about
whom Lammy talked so constantly that the visitor
could not but hear of her, and asked to see the portfolio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of drawings in which were some of hers, and he
praised them very highly for their promise.</p>

<p>The Lanes arrived in New York just before dark
of a Tuesday afternoon, and spent the rest of the
evening in looking out of their windows at the remarkable
and confused thoroughfare below them that
was made still more of a spectacle by the glare of
electric lights. Lammy wished to go and look for
Bird at once, but his father wouldn&rsquo;t hear of doing so
until broad daylight, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive, it ain&rsquo;t safe. I&rsquo;ve been across Hill&rsquo;s
swamp without a lantern on a foggy night a-callin&rsquo;
up lost sheep, but that down there with them queer
kind o&rsquo; two-wheel carts that bob along in narrow
places like teeter snipe crossin&rsquo; the mill-dam, I&rsquo;ll not
venture it, leastwise not with mother along.&rdquo; So
Lammy went to bed to kill time, but a little later curiosity
got the better of Joshua, and he spent an hour
in the lobby, where he learned, besides several other
things, that the &ldquo;teeter snipe&rdquo; carts were called
&ldquo;hansome cabs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the surprise of the early-rising country folk, it
was eleven o&rsquo;clock the next morning before they
found themselves ready to take a south-bound Fourth
Avenue car, for the visit to Bird, and Joshua told the
conductor four times in ten blocks where they wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to get off, and what they were going for, while Mrs.
Lane sat still, smiling and quivering all over from the
shiney tips of her first boots (other than Congress
gaiters) to the jet fandango atop of a real Northboro
store bonnet, and the smile was so infectious that it
soon spread through the entire car.</p>

<p>When they got off at 24th Street and made the
sidewalk in tremulous safety, they marched east in
silence, counting the numbers as they went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much of a neighbourhood,&rdquo; sniffed Mrs.
Lane, wondering at the ash barrels and pails of swill
that lined the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jedge hasty, mother,&rdquo; said Joshua; &ldquo;we
mustn&rsquo;t be hard on city folks that ain&rsquo;t got our advantages
in the way o&rsquo; pigs to turn swill into meat, and
bog-holes ter swaller ashes what don&rsquo;t go to road-makin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be near there,&rdquo; gasped Lauretta Ann,
presently. She had been persuaded to have her new
gown made a &ldquo;stylish length&rdquo; by Hope Snippin, the
village dressmaker, in consequence of which she was
grasping her skirts on both sides, floundering and
plunging along very much like an old-style market
schooner, with its sails fouled in the rigging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, look there!&rdquo; said Lammy, with
white, trembling lips. He had been running on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ahead and keeping track of the numbers, but he
now stood still, pointing to a half block of burned
and ruined buildings, walled in ice and draped with
cruel icicles that seemed to pierce his very flesh as
he gazed at them.</p>

<p>For a minute they were all fairly speechless and
stood open-mouthed, then Joshua, recovering first,
settled his teeth firmly back in place, and laughing
feebly, said: &ldquo;Been a fire, I reckon; thet&rsquo;s
nothing. I&rsquo;ve heard somethin&rsquo; gets afire as often
as every week in N&rsquo;York. They must be somewhere,
and we&rsquo;ll jest calm down and ask the neighbours
over the way&mdash;in course they&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to Joshua&rsquo;s wonder they didn&rsquo;t, at least not
definitely, and all he could learn was that the
O&rsquo;Mores had moved somewhere a couple of blocks
&ldquo;over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh, but ain&rsquo;t N&rsquo;York a heathen town,&rdquo; muttered
Joshua; &ldquo;jest think, folks burned out an&rsquo; their
neighbours don&rsquo;t take no trouble about &rsquo;em; we
might even get knocked down, and I bet they
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised. I&rsquo;d like to strike fer
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they wandered helplessly along block after
block, the crowd of workmen and children in the
streets coming home to dinner told that it was noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no use in going they did not know
where, and they had not met a single policeman
whom they could question. As they stood upon
a corner consulting as to what they had best do,
a group of girls coming up and dividing passed
on either side of them, one bold-looking chit in a
red plush hat and soiled gown singing out something
about &ldquo;When Reuben comes to town,&rdquo;
and giving Lammy a push at the same time.</p>

<p>As he turned to avoid her, he heard his name
called, and breaking from her mates, a slender little
figure with big black eyes dropped her satchel and
flung her arms around his neck, heedless of the
merriment and jeers of her companions. Bird was
found at last!</p>

<p>There was no longer any use in trying to keep
up the barrier of pride, or of pretending she was
happy, and Bird led her friends home to the new
flat, wherein O&rsquo;More had established his family on
his return.</p>

<p>That afternoon there was a long powwow in
which Mrs. O&rsquo;More made herself very disagreeable,
as she had come to rely upon Bird and did not
wish to have Billy back upon her hands, but John
O&rsquo;More stood firm by his promise, saying, even if
he&rsquo;d never made it, Bird should have her choice after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the way she&rsquo;d stood by Billy in time of need. &ldquo;She
stuck by her blood kin, and she&rsquo;s a lady through and
through, and we&rsquo;re different, and it&rsquo;s neither&rsquo;s fault
that we&rsquo;re a reproach to each other,&rdquo; was O&rsquo;More&rsquo;s
summing up. &ldquo;If you can keep her, you can take
her, but God help little Billy! The doctor says
good care a couple o&rsquo; years more, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll have a
chance for his leg. I can pay for care, but it&rsquo;s not
to be bought around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane saw the tears in the rough man&rsquo;s eyes,
and her big mother-heart throbbed, and to some purpose,
as usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our doctor&rsquo;s wife would take him to board, I
guess,&rdquo; she said, after thinking a minute. &ldquo;She took
a little boy from Northboro last summer, and did
real well by him, her children bein&rsquo; grown now and
out of hand. Dr. Jedd, he&rsquo;d give him care besides.
I&rsquo;ll take him along with us if you think he&rsquo;ll grieve,
and you can write or come up and settle it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only then that Bird&rsquo;s happiness was complete,
and little Billy hugged and hugged her, and
cried in his piping voice, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to fly
away out of the cage to your country for <em>sure</em> this
time,&rdquo; and Bird answered joyfully and truthfully,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the sooner we&rsquo;ll fly, the better I&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
added Joshua. &ldquo;This very afternoon would suit
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lauretta Ann had determined upon two things:
she was going to buy the material for a black silk
gown in New York, also a handsome china jar to
contain the remains of the pewter tea-pot and be &ldquo;a
moniment to Aunt Jimmy,&rdquo; in the centre of the India
china on the living-room mantel-shelf. Mrs. O&rsquo;More,
sullenly accepting her defeat, and now in her element,
which was buying dress goods, offered to conduct the
stranger through the mazes of Sixth Avenue department
stores; so after a hasty lunch they set out,
while her husband and Joshua Lane talked matters
over, and the children were in a seventh heaven of
anticipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s on me mind,&mdash;that ring the girl sold
to buy doctorin&rsquo; for Billy. I only hope she got the
worth of it, and that the man&rsquo;s on the square, for she
won&rsquo;t give me the name of the gent that bought it,
and when I&rsquo;m picked a bit out o&rsquo; me trouble, I&rsquo;d like
to buy back the same, for the keepsake is her only
fortune. Maybe some day you can coax the name
out o&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely I can&mdash;plenty o&rsquo; time for that,&rdquo; drawled
Joshua, who usually knew more than he appeared to.</p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The next afternoon five tired but happy people
arrived at the Centre and electrified the neighbourhood
by hiring a hack to take them to Laurelville,
Joshua having only been persuaded to stay two days
of the proposed week&rsquo;s excursion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to have Hope Snippin up to-morrow
morning to shorten my gown,&rdquo; was Mrs. Lane&rsquo;s greeting
to the minister&rsquo;s wife when she opened the door
in alarm at the unexpected return, while Twinkle
leaped into Bird&rsquo;s arms, fairly screaming with dog
joy.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that the sudden return was
not wholly a surprise. Somebody had sent a telegram
to somebody, and Joshua&rsquo;s manner in the interval
before supper cast the suspicion upon him. After
Bird had seen her pretty room and coaxed Billy,
who was nodding drowsily, to eat his bread and milk
and go to bed before the real supper, she came down
to the living-room, where the table was spread for the
first time instead of in the kitchen, for Dinah Lucky
came in a few hours every day now to do the heavy
work and give Mrs. Lane more leisure. A stranger
was sitting by the fire. He rose and took Bird by the
hand very gently and drew her to the lounge beside
him, at the same time handing her a letter. She was
too much surprised to notice that no one introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
her or told his name. She opened the letter; her
keepsake ring rolled into her lap as she read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Bertha O&rsquo;More</span>: I know all about you
now, and I believed in you from the first. Here is
your ring; wear it about your neck as before for a
keepsake, until some day, ten years or so hence&mdash;then
ask the one you love best to put it upon
your left hand. With the respect of your friend,</p>

<p class="sgn">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Marion Clarke&rsquo;s Father.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="r2">&ldquo;P.S. The bearer of this letter is Alfred Rawley,
your grandmother&rsquo;s youngest brother!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of her bewilderment, her first thought
was, &ldquo;So he was really Marion&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; Next
spring she would beg him to give Tessie the holiday
that he had offered her that Christmastide in the
twilight of the church.</p>

<p>Joshua Lane capered about like a young kid as
his wife tried to chase him into a corner, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Now you jest up and tell me how long
you&rsquo;ve known all this, and not told your lawful
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, let me see,&rdquo; he said, counting on his
fingers; &ldquo;considerable longer than it&rsquo;ll take us to
eat supper,&rdquo; was all the answer she received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="ast">******</p>

<p>That night Bird opened her bedroom window
and looked out into the frosty moonlight, where
far away in the distance the runaway Christmas
trees were outlined against the sky and the roots
of red peony that Lammy planted were waiting
under the ground for their spring blooming time
to come. Stretching out her arms as she drew in
great reviving breaths of the clear, frosty air,
then clasping her hands together, she whispered,
&ldquo;Terry, dear, you know it all; you know your Bird
is free again, and that she remembers, and now
you must help her to fly the right way.&rdquo;</p>
